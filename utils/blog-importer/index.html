      Around two years ago, the first Polkadot
      <a href="https://www.polkadot.network/features/parachains/">parachain</a>
      slots were secured with the help of
      <a href="https://www.polkadot.network/features/auctions/">crowdloans</a>,
      a way for DOT holders to support their favorite parachain projects and get
      rewarded in return, typically with the project’s native token. With the
      two-year lease period for Polkadot’s first parachains now coming to a
      close, early crowdloan contributors are set to have their DOT
      contributions unlocked and free for use.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind, and as crowdloan contributors consider what to do with
      their newly unlocked DOT, let’s take a look at token utility and the
      different ways DOT can be used in the Polkadot ecosystem. From helping
      secure Polkadot’s Nominated-Proof-of-Stake (<a
        href="https://www.polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-consensus-part-1-enhanced-economic-security-via-npos/"
        >NPoS</a
      >) system to participating in governance, dapps, and crowdloans,
      Polkadot’s native token has a number of uses that support the network and
      offer benefits in return.

    <h2 id="staking">Staking</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.polkadot.network/features/staking/"
        >Staking DOT natively</a
      >
      serves a dual purpose: it helps protect Polkadot from malicious attacks
      while also supporting the network’s decentralization. Staking on Polkadot
      also enables DOT holders to collect staking rewards for their service of
      helping secure the network.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stakers in Polkadot’s NPoS system are called nominators because they
      nominate validators to secure the network. Validators play a more
      technical role of securing the network and participating in consensus and
      block production.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways to stake on Polkadot. Native staking, which means
      staking directly on Polkadot without going through an intermediary,
      enables you to stay in full control of your DOT and has benefits for the
      network in terms of security and decentralization. The easiest way to
      stake natively is to join a nomination pool. DOT holders can join a
      nomination pool with as little as 1 DOT, and get a more passive staking
      experience, as they don’t need to select their own validators, monitor
      validator performance, or regularly update their nominations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, more advanced stakers can nominate directly by selecting
      their own list of up to 16 validators. This method requires a bit more
      active engagement, as nominators should research validators, monitor their
      performance, and periodically update their nominations. Nominating on
      Polkadot is not without risk, as nominators can lose a portion of their
      DOT tokens via
      <a
        href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout#slashing"
        >slashing</a
      >
      if they select a malicious validator.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Direct nominators also need to make sure they stake more tokens than the
      minimum amount required to be an active nominator and receive rewards.
      This amount is currently around 450 DOT and increases as participation in
      staking increases. Nominators who are confident in their ability to select
      trustworthy validators can also
      <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-staking-pools"
        >open their own nomination pool</a
      >
      and allow others to join.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview"
        >Polkadot’s Staking Dashboard</a
      >
      is an easy way to start nominating, directly or by nomination pool. The
      dashboard supports several Polkadot wallets and provides a simple
      interface where nominators can manage their nominations, join pools, and
      optimize their staking rewards. Tutorials for the staking dashboard can be
      found

        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several Polkadot wallets also support staking, including
      <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova Wallet</a>,
      <a href="https://www.talisman.xyz/">Talisman</a>,
      <a href="https://fearlesswallet.io/">Fearless Wallet</a> and
      <a href="https://www.subwallet.app/">SubWallet</a>. For an overview of
      Polkadot wallets and their included features, visit the
      <a href="https://www.polkadot.network/ecosystem/wallets/"
        >Polkadot wallets page</a
      >. Cold/hardware wallets are recommended for the highest level of
      security; hardware wallets currently supported are
      <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ledger">Ledger</a> and
      <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-vault"
        >Polkadot Vault</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several other staking options exist beyond native staking, including
      staking via third-party custodial services and exchanges. Some Polkadot
      parachains, including Bifrost, Acala, and Equilibrium, also offer liquid
      staking features that offer additional capabilities to stakers. DOT
      holders are recommended to thoroughly research third-party custodial and
      liquid staking services before participating, as they involve different
      risks than native staking.

    <h2 id="participating-in-governance">Participating in governance</h2>
    <p>
      Polkadot's
      <a href="https://www.polkadot.network/features/opengov/">OpenGov</a> is
      perhaps the most advanced governance system in Web3. Launched earlier in
      2023, it allows anyone with DOT to propose or vote on referenda, and
      brings greater decentralization than Polkadot’s previous governance
      system. Along with NPoS, OpenGov is one of the Polkadot features that make
      it among the most decentralized networks in Web3.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenGov provides significant advantages compared with other networks:
      multiple referenda can run simultaneously, meaning changes can be deployed
      more rapidly (or in the case of a request for Treasury funds, tokens can
      be released faster). “Conviction voting” - locking tokens up for longer -
      helps level the playing field for those with fewer tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT holders are encouraged to participate in OpenGov and make their voices
      heard. Learn about how to participate on the
      <a href="https://www.polkadot.network/features/opengov/">OpenGov page</a>

      >, and learn how the Treasury works
      <a href="https://www.polkadot.network/ecosystem/treasury/">here</a>.
      Governance proposals are discussed and voted on via governance interfaces
      such as
      <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/opengov">Polkassembly</a> and
      <a href="https://polkadot.subsquare.io/">Subsquare</a>. Those who don’t
      have the time or desire to participate actively in governance can delegate
      their voting power to someone to vote on their behalf. Learn about vote
      delegation

    <h2 id="using-dot-with-polkadot-applications">
      Using DOT with Polkadot applications
    </h2>
    <p>
      Polkadot is a rich ecosystem with hundreds of diverse dapps and projects.
      These cover a wide gamut of use cases, such as gaming, NFTs, DeFi,
      privacy, smart contracts, ID, data, storage, sustainability, social media
      and IoT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the dapps that users may wish to explore support participation via
      DOT, while others will require using parachain native tokens. Solutions
      are currently under development to seamlessly use DOT for all ecosystem
      applications. As always, DOT holders should conduct thorough research
      before using any applications as they may carry their own risks. To see
      what dapps are live in the ecosystem, check out this
      <a href="https://dotinsights.subwallet.app/projects/">ecosystem page</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="participating-in-crowdloans">Participating in Crowdloans</h2>
    <p>
      While the crowdloan model is expected to eventually be phased out with the
      development of
      <a
        href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-direction#from-slot-auctions-to-coretime-marketplace"
        >new, more agile ways to allocate Polkadot’s compute resources</a
      >, some projects may still be conducting crowdloans in the near future
      that DOT holders can participate in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Joining crowdloans is a way of supporting early-stage parachains, enabling
      a much lower barrier of entry than would otherwise be the case.
      Contributing to a crowdloan involves locking DOT tokens for up to two
      years (the duration of the parachain’s lease). Parachain teams choose how
      to reward their contributors for joining their communities, though
      typically they do this with a portion of their native token. After the
      parachain’s lease expires (typically two years) all DOT from contributors
      is unlocked and once again free for use in staking, governance, etc.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to note that crowdloan participation may involve different
      risks than other uses of DOT such as staking, as market conditions can
      change greatly during the period that crowdloan contributions are
      locked.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.polkadot.network/features/dot-token/">DOT</a> is the
      primary tool for people to interact with, secure, and coordinate the
      Polkadot network, and has many uses across the ecosystem. Future
      developments may also bring additional uses for DOT, such as purchases of
      <a
        href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-direction#from-slot-auctions-to-coretime-marketplace"
        >coretime</a
      >
      as part of ongoing proposals for Polkadot’s future roadmap. These and any
      future upgrades will need to be approved by OpenGov. As a DOT holder,
      Polkadot gives you a say in how the network is run, giving you an active
      role in the movement for a better web.&nbsp;
