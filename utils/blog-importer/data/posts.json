    "html": "<p>Blockchain technology has opened up a world of possibilities, and nowhere is this more evident than in the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI). The Polkadot network is at the forefront of this revolution, serving as a powerful platform for innovative AI projects that are pushing the boundaries of what's possible. In this blog, we'll dive into some of the most exciting AI initiatives within the Polkadot ecosystem, exploring how these projects are leveraging Polkadot's advanced capabilities to solve real-world challenges and shape the future of decentralized AI. From decentralized knowledge graphs to secure computing infrastructure and peer-to-peer learning, the Polkadot blockchain is proving to be an essential enabler of the AI revolution.&nbsp;</p><p>Join us as we explore this dynamic intersection of cutting-edge technology, where the potential of AI is unleashed through the power of Polkadot.</p><h3 id=\"origintraildecentralizing-knowledge-for-ai-models\"><strong>OriginTrail - Decentralizing Knowledge for AI Models</strong></h3><p>In an era of digital information, the internet has given us massive opportunities with loads of valuable information at our fingertips. However, this has also introduced a world where misinformation quite often takes hold. In an effort to combat this, OriginTrail presents a unique solution leveraging blockchain technology with AI to create original sources of information.&nbsp;</p><p>With OriginTrail, enterprises and individuals can build Knowledge Assets that contain valuable information or intellectual property and tie those into the ecosystem’s decentralized knowledge graph (DKG). This graph organizes critical data, making it discoverable and verifiable, which is a crucial foundation for trusted AI solutions. Instead of purely generated (possibly hallucinated) AI responses, DKG enables AI outputs with information provenance and verifiability. The same data can also be used for safer and more effective training of AI models. The DKG and Neuroweb, a permissionless EVM blockchain secured by Polkadot validators, allow for these knowledge assets to be searchable and verifiable by any AI model.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Polkadot?</strong> While OriginTrail's Knowledge assets and functionalities are multi-chain, the latest version of the DKG V6 was initially launched on NeuroWeb, a parachain on Polkadot's scalable infrastructure. NeuroWeb is also the only blockchain focused on pursuing a truly open and decentralized AI future by incentivizing high-quality knowledge creation through Knowledge mining. The strength of Polkadot’s blockchain technology ensures the verifiability and security of both, NeuroWeb blockchain and the DKG, enabling a powerful merge of Web3 and AI technologies. This pathway for OriginTrail allows for inclusiveness, interoperability, neutrality and an innovation in their approach.</p><p><a href=\"https://origintrail.io/\"><u>👉 Learn More and Get Involved with OriginTrail</u></a></p><p></p><h3 id=\"phala-networksecure-and-scalable-computing-for-ai\"><strong>Phala Network - Secure and Scalable Computing for AI</strong></h3><p>Phala Network recently unveiled its newest advancement on their platform, pivoting from the Phat Contract to what is now called an AI-Agent Contract. This new framework along with its decentralized network, supportive AI models, and secure technology allows for facilitating coordination and collaboration between decentralized AI agents operating on a blockchain network. This move is deeply intentional to mark AI as vital to the activities on blockchain, while also enabling secure, efficient, and scalable computation.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more is that Phala is proposing these AI agents can work on complex problems, without a centralized authority, and do so across a variety of blockchain networks. The implications of this technology are significant, as it opens the door to building genuinely autonomous AI systems that can learn, reason, and make decisions in a decentralized way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Polkadot?</strong> Phala's integration with Polkadot enhances its capability to offer verifiable computation and data protection, making Web3 applications safer, faster, and more reliable.</p><p>👉 <a href=\"https://phala.network/ai\"><u>Explore Phala Network’s AI-Agent Contract</u></a></p><h3 id=\"bittensordecentralized-ai-through-peer-to-peer-learning\"><strong>Bittensor - Decentralized AI through Peer-to-Peer Learning</strong></h3><p>Bittensor is revolutionizing machine learning and AI development through a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. The core idea behind Bittensor is to create a marketplace for machine intelligence, where AI models can collaborate, share knowledge, and learn from one another in a decentralized manner.

The Academy has reached a level of maturity whereby we feel it’s right to allow access to a select number of students joining us for Wave 5 in Singapore from <a href=\"https://page.polkadot.academy/pba-application-form\">wherever they may be in the world.</a></p>\n<p>So, from May 20th to June 20th, not all of our students will be on-campus in Singapore. Whilst we have closed applications for the in-person course and are sorting through those at present, we have now opened applications exclusively for students who prefer to join us remotely.

Not everyone can easily travel to all of our locations. Some people may find the cost and logistics of travel difficult, for example. Others may have personal reasons for preferring to learn remotely.</p>\n<p>By catering for some of these developers, we feel we’ll be even better positioned to maintain our standing as one of the leading blockchain courses in the world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-will-pba-remote-work\">How will PBA Remote work?</h2>\n<p>Students will be able to <strong>attend lectures in real time, or close to real time.</strong> This way they can participate synchronously with students attending in person in Singapore, asking questions, receiving answers and generally participating in the course as though they are actually in Singapore.</p>\n<p>Clearly, this means that if you are thinking of being a PBA Remote student and are in a time zone that is very different to Singapore’s, ideally you’ll need to make some temporary lifestyle adjustments.</p>\n<p>We also recognize we need to make some adjustments too.

    "html": "<p><em>The blockchain space is continuously evolving, and with it the opportunities for development and innovation expand. The latest milestone in this story is the exciting launch of the Polkadot Alpha Program, a groundbreaking initiative that lowers entry barriers and fosters a more dynamic environment for teams aiming to bring their blockchain projects to life.</em></p><h3 id=\"launching-in-time-for-agile-coretime\"><strong>Launching in time for Agile Coretime</strong></h3><p>The Polkadot Alpha Program comes at a pivotal moment as builders anticipate the arrival of <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/features/blockspace/agile-coretime/\"><u>Agile Coretime</u></a>, when the barriers to launch parachain projects will be considerably reduced. Using ready-made templates and through purchasing coretime, any team can become production-ready in a matter of days. This development means the previous Square One and Substrate Builder Programs, which were dedicated support programs with curated participants, had become less relevant, requiring a refresh. In essence, the Alpha Program was introduced as a unique zero-dependency support line, including resources, community involvement and the opportunity to provide quality feedback on Polkadot’s core products. It’s the ideal platform for teams ready to take their projects to the next level.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-the-polkadot-alpha-program\"><strong>What is the Polkadot Alpha Program?</strong></h3><p>The Polkadot Alpha Program is inspired by the concept of “alpha testing” in software development, where end-to-end testing is conducted to ensure a product meets business requirements and functions correctly. However, it transcends the traditional confines of Web2 (which conducts tests in-house), instead embracing the decentralized ethos of Web3 by encouraging a community approach. This not only democratizes the development process - it also integrates feedback and improvements directly from the user base.</p><p>The Polkadot Alpha Program is about discovery, experimentation, and collaboration. If you have a new Web3 project, you can:</p><p><strong>Build, launch, and scale your product quickly and efficiently: </strong>Alpha test the latest features and core product releases within the Polkadot ecosystem to then launch your product efficiently through access to Polkadot Alpha’s comprehensive resources.</p><p><strong>Gain visibility and traction quickly within the Polkadot community and beyond:</strong> Become an integral part of the Alpha community, fostering collaboration and receiving support from like-minded developers and teams.</p><p><strong>Shape the future of Polkadot and be at the forefront of its evolution:</strong> Stay ahead of the curve by accessing the latest features and core product releases from the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><h3 id=\"who-can-join-the-program\"><strong>Who Can Join the Program?</strong></h3><p>The Polkadot Alpha Program is open to teams at various stages of development, including:</p><p><strong>Parachain Teams:</strong> Those developing new chains or products within the Polkadot network, aiming to transition from prototypes to fully operational parachains.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure Providers:</strong> Entities dedicated to enhancing the ecosystem's infrastructure, such as node services, security solutions, and API interfaces.</p><p><strong>Dapp Teams:</strong> Innovators exploring and validating new blockchain concepts, eager to leverage the program's resources to refine and potentially scale their ideas.</p><h3 id=\"why-join-the-polkadot-alpha-program\"><strong>Why Join the Polkadot Alpha Program?</strong></h3><p>Joining the Polkadot Alpha Program means more than just access to resources; it's an opportunity to be at the forefront of blockchain innovation. The program facilitates a shift from a structured, \"waterfall-like\" development process to an agile, community-driven approach. This not only accelerates the journey from prototype to live parachain but also embodies the spirit of decentralization, with support and resources readily available to all teams.</p><h3 id=\"ready-to-dive-in\"><strong>Ready to Dive In?</strong></h3><p>The Polkadot Alpha Program is calling for pioneers, innovators, and visionaries. If you're ready to take your project from concept to reality while contributing to one of the most exciting ecosystems in blockchain, <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/development/alpha/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>apply now</u></a> to be part of this transformative journey.</p>",

    "html": "<p>If you’re launching a great concept at the bleeding edge of Web3 technology, there are two things that are vitally important for success.</p><p>First and foremost, you need to have the highest quality engineering talent: individuals with the capability and ambition to help you maximize the potential of your project. Developers who are happy to get their hands dirty at the coalface while writing outstanding code and unearthing new possibilities for blockchain are a valuable commodity indeed.</p><p>Secondly, and just as importantly, you want to develop your own understanding of blockchain and the people taking it forward. You’ll want to have a strong understanding of how cryptography drives the decentralized world, alongside some great networking channels to help you collaborate with the best in the business.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/\"><u>Polkadot Blockchain Academy</u></a> (PBA), since its inception in August 2022, has made such rapid progress that it can now confidently satisfy both these key objectives. And applications for Wave 5 in Singapore, starting May 20th, are open now!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">APPLY FOR PBA WAVE 5</a></div><p>Now split into two separate curricula - one is designed for core developers, the other is specifically tailored for founders - PBA produces individuals who are readily equipped to put the next great idea for Web3 to the test. An early-stage founding team needs visionaries and entrepreneurs, but it needs them to have a conceptual understanding of what exactly the engineers are building - and it also needs those engineers to build out the foundations.</p><h2 id=\"before-pba-thin-pickings\">Before PBA: Thin pickings</h2><p>It was after the first surge of public interest in cryptocurrencies in 2017 that established universities began looking into the possibility of offering blockchain-centered courses to sit outside their regular degree courses.</p><p>Such courses - at places like MIT, Cornell, Columbia, Oxford and Cambridge - are reasonably comprehensive. But they’re also largely theoretical, providing a grounding in the mechanics of various blockchain protocols, the advantages they offer over traditional tech infrastructure, plus security and privacy principles, decentralization, and so on. These foundational courses largely serve to stimulate curiosity - they have no deep practical application.</p><p>Other programs are different, offering accelerated vocational training which caters for individuals with some knowledge of cryptography and digital assets. These courses feature more granular and technical education.</p><p>But even these are not really enough. You can’t emerge from one of these courses and start coding the next iteration of an established Web3 tech stack, or even join a team of engineers as a junior developer.</p><h2 id=\"a-relevant-curriculum\">A relevant curriculum</h2><p>That’s obviously where PBA comes in - because it is designed to be both theoretical and also applicable to what is current within Polkadot. This mean it is producing highly skilled developers who will be ready to hit the ground running, and after three completed waves of PBA, the evidence suggests that’s exactly what’s happening.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/group-picture-cropped-1.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1541\" height=\"740\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/group-picture-cropped-1.jpeg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/group-picture-cropped-1.jpeg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/group-picture-cropped-1.jpeg 1541w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Among the success metrics, the following stand out:</p><ul><li>Of 160 graduates from the first three waves, 46% have found full or part-time roles in Polkadot within three months of leaving PBA</li><li>57 were hired directly by Polkadot ecosystem projects, including Parity Technologies and Web3 Foundation</li><li>Others have chosen to start up their own Web3 projects, of which 20 are already up and running</li><li>Six graduates are known to have joined the Fellowship, a relatively new initiative to create an expert body of developers who are integral to Polkadot’s pioneering decentralized governance structure</li></ul><p>As Derek Yoo, the founder of <a href=\"https://moonbeam.network/\"><u>Moonbeam</u></a>, explains: “The critical ingredient for building Web3 protocols is talented software engineers. But finding engineers with the right knowledge is very challenging. PBA consistently produces excellent candidates with the right skills for us to hire.”</p><p>Branimir Rakic, the founder of <a href=\"https://origintrail.io/\"><u>OriginTrail</u></a>, identified a particular engineer, Nikola, to send to PBA. Afterwards, he reported: “Nikola has emerged as a key figure, armed with the knowledge acquired from the Academy, propelling us forward and playing a pivotal role in the successful launch of our parachain.\"</p><h2 id=\"new-devs-often-lack-skills\">New devs often lack skills</h2><p>In the wider world of Web3 at large, the impact of PBA has not yet been felt, however. There is, it seems, a global skills gap hampering recruiting efforts: if teams need to grow or even just replace existing talent, the new people coming in are not best equipped to keep the fires burning.</p><p>A leading Web3 data analysis provider, <a href=\"https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=developer-losses-came-from-the\"><u>Electric Capital</u></a>, reported that 52% of developers classified as “newcomers” - that is those who had worked in crypto for less than a year - had lost their jobs during the course of 2023.</p><p>By contrast, the most established developers, those who had worked in crypto for between more than two years, were <a href=\"https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=established-devs-have-grown-52\" rel=\"noreferrer\">up 52% over five years</a> and at all-time highs by the end of last year. </p><p>While there may be other factors at play, the Electric Capital findings were a worrying indicator that the quality of education received by novice developers who have not had the benefit of a PBA education is simply not good enough to guarantee a sustained career.</p><p>PBA graduates, on the other hand, can have better expectations of success.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/PBA-HK-20240103-preview-0017-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/PBA-HK-20240103-preview-0017-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/PBA-HK-20240103-preview-0017-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/PBA-HK-20240103-preview-0017-1.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/PBA-HK-20240103-preview-0017-1.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Alex Theissen, Smart Contracts Execution Lead at <a href=\"https://www.parity.io/\"><u>Parity Technologies</u></a>, a leading technical contributor to Polkadot, says: “We've made some strong hires from the PBA. I feel PBA gives us access to some developers that a normal recruiting process would not; it seems to motivate really strong developers to come to work at Parity or on Polkadot. PBA also makes onboarding a lot quicker and easier. In most instances, we get to productivity fast.”</p><h2 id=\"fresh-focus-on-founders\">Fresh focus on founders</h2><p>So if it’s accepted that the great software engineers of Web3 need better education (and that PBA is actively addressing that necessity), then what about the founders, the entrepreneurs, the ones with the big ideas, those hunting that all-important VC investment that will drive future waves of adoption in the space?</p><p>Until Wave 3 of PBA got under way in Berkeley, California in the summer of 2023, this was a group whose needs had largely been ignored. It was in Berkeley, however, that PBA first offered its <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/polkadot-blockchain-academy_polkadotacademy-web3innovation-founderstrack-activity-7110978554988740608-z_6I/\"><u>Founders Track</u></a>, and the course proved so successful that it is now integral to PBA’s future.</p><p>The Founders Track aims to help its students understand fundamental concepts of cryptography, economics and game theory, and how they relate to Blockchain, Polkadot itself and Web3 application design.</p><p>It explores the essential processes of building a business, including aspects like product-market fit, community-orientation, governance, talent, marketing, legal &amp; regulation issues.</p><p>It provides exposure to Polkadot’s ecosystem, unlocking major networking opportunities with ecosystem and industry experts at a global level (and this is one of the main advantages of PBA being an in-person only experience).</p><p>And there’s more: guidance on the entire process around fundraising, plus advice on acceleration opportunities, mentorship, building support and grant-based funding. Importantly, it provides a validation service that helps founders refine their idea so it can be effectively molded into a future Polkadot project.</p><h2 id=\"polkadots-apac-expansion\">Polkadot's APAC expansion</h2><p>PBA, and Polkadot at large, is making a concerted effort to <a href=\"https://www.crypto-reporter.com/press-releases/polkadot-blockchain-academy-bets-big-on-apac-talent-with-education-programs-launching-in-hong-kong-and-singapore-54029/\"><u>focus on the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region</u></a> in early 2024. Wave 4 is wrapping up in Hong Kong right now, and this will be followed by Wave 5 in Singapore from May 20th to June 20th. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/events/sub0/\"><u>sub0</u></a>, the Polkadot developer conference, is slated for March 12th and 13th in Bangkok.</p><p>So, why APAC? Perhaps surprisingly, considering the general lie of the land not all that long ago, APAC has jurisdictions offering some of the most clear and consistent regulatory guidelines in the world.</p><p>Hong Kong’s government, for instance, has provided a licensing framework that allows retail investors to trade crypto. In Singapore, Ripple Labs and Coinbase - two major players in the space who have hit roadblocks in other parts of the world - have secured licenses of their own that will allow them to bolster their growth in the APAC region.</p><p>On top of this, APAC is producing an exciting generation of “<a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP50587223\"><u>digital natives</u></a>”, young entrepreneurs who have grown up in an educational set-up that has valued tech more highly than other parts of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>These people are converting the old “Made in Asia” narrative that drove the “old” global tech revolution into a “Born in Asia” storyline that magnifies the potential that people in APAC have to make a transformative difference in global tech, and by extension within blockchain and Web3.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/polkadot-8-9-23-drew-bird-1158-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/polkadot-8-9-23-drew-bird-1158-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/polkadot-8-9-23-drew-bird-1158-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/polkadot-8-9-23-drew-bird-1158-1.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/polkadot-8-9-23-drew-bird-1158-1.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Wherever PBA goes in the world, one of its most important principles is to bring together the people who are building on Polkadot and the people who are learning about it.</p><p>It’s the best chance you will ever get of finding out why people have chosen Polkadot, and what sets it apart from the Web3 crowd as both a community and as a tech stack.</p><h2 id=\"big-upgrades-on-the-way\">Big upgrades on the way</h2><p>And this might be the best time of all to apply: 2024 could be one of the most exciting years yet for the network, as the technology adjusts to allow “<a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-direction\"><u>coretime</u></a>” to take over from the parachain model. An appreciation of Polkadot as a computational resource as opposed to a collection of chains - and what precisely this involves - is an important new concept to take on board.</p><p>By spending a month at PBA, you could be up close with the people who are helping direct this onward movement. Moreover, they could be the same people who will help you define your career, whether you're trying to launch a product on Polkadot or simply looking for a role within the ecosystem.</p><p>Being part of PBA doesn’t end on graduation day either. Previous cohorts are already busy organizing their own alumni events, and official get-togethers are scheduled to coincide with major ecosystem events like sub0 and <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/events/decoded-2023/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Decoded</a> too. The Academy provides continuous learning opportunities after graduation, with a dedicated communication channel for alumni to share support and weekly online meet-ups.</p><p>PBA will always be free, and there will never be any obligation for students to be involved in Polkadot or Web3 once they graduate. But if you don’t fully satisfy your curiosity about Web3 and Polkadot by giving it a go, you’ll never know what you might be missing out on.</p><p><a href=\"https://polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apply now!</a></p>",

    "html": "<p>Polkadot’s final quarter of 2023 featured sustained organic growth, including pronounced spikes in transactional data in late December. Fees remained stable despite the network hitting record levels of daily activity.</p><p>This newly demonstrated scalability sets the network up for a year of enhanced enterprise adoption, at a time when projects like <a href=\"https://mewe.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MeWe</a> and <a href=\"https://mythicalgames.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mythical Games</a> are bringing large numbers of users into the ecosystem.</p><p>Along with some groundbreaking technical upgrades on the horizon, including trustless bridges, asynchronous backing, and on-demand parachains, these capabilities ensure it will be easier than ever for new ventures to join the ecosystem.</p><p>With initiatives like OpenGov and XCM now well established, and <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-direction\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Agile Coretime</a> poised to improve the way parachains connect to the network, a stronger than ever foundational framework is in place.</p><h2 id=\"inscriptions-lead-to-record-transaction-figures\">Inscriptions lead to record transaction figures</h2><p>According to data from <a href=\"https://www.subscan.io/\"><u>Subscan</u></a>, transactions on the Polkadot Relay Chain rose from an average of just under 230,000 monthly DOT transactions in the first three quarters of 2023 to 378,868 in October and 339,865 in November, before leaping to 17,391,296 for December, smashing all previous records.</p><p>Commenting on the December spike, Polkadot founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rphmeier\"><u>Robert Habermeier</u></a> posted on X on December 21st: “1 Million transactions today on the Polkadot relay chain. This is the highest activity day on Polkadot in history, topping out the 941,000 transactions on May 5, 2021. The activity is due to inscriptions.”</p><p>At the height of this user activity, Habermeier reported just shy of 13 million transactions in a 48-hour period during which time Polkadot’s Treasury, which is managed by its token holders, collected 110,000 DOT.</p><h2 id=\"fees-remain-stable-despite-increased-demand\">Fees remain stable despite increased demand</h2><p>Crucially, the network was able to support this increased demand without the spike in transaction fees typically seen on other networks. Average daily transaction fees hovered close to 0.02 DOT for all of December.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-eu.googleusercontent.com/YPBMJLPwvOJSjfRFPlVAvKjWRbgUqadbZgdq7MlQxvlXF6iUryXKynin3zSiVTRtnkas55DadYwZbTDf_XfCy_ES9rpbBpdbNy4NV_ZIACMUlC8t-QXXqNIFzACaUPN_dfym6r4m7lgGIQujQ7IOPEg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"857\"></figure><p>The chart above features data supplied by DotLake, a data platform reflecting activity on Polkadot and its ecosystem, and maintained by engineers and analysts at Parity Technologies. It indicates that fees remained stable, indicating the superior scalability offered by Polkadot in comparison to other networks.</p><p>Inevitably, those impressive transaction numbers were also reflected in other adoption metrics.</p><h2 id=\"xcm-events-native-usdc-on-the-rise\">XCM, events &amp; native USDC on the rise</h2><p>Polkadot’s native cross-consensus messaging format, XCM, also saw a hike in activity in Q4. An average of around 17,000 messages were recorded per month from January to September; this doubled in October, hit 39,162 in November and then sprinted to 449,813 in December (all data per Subscan).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/new_image--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"918\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/new_image--1-.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/new_image--1-.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/new_image--1-.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/new_image--1-.png 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Similarly, the DotLake chart above indicates sustained growth in monthly on-chain “events” across Polkadot’s Relay Chain and parachains - and then a big December spike. Events include \"outputs” from extrinsic calls such as transfers, swaps, and staking, or what most users would think of as actual transactions on the blockchain.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-eu.googleusercontent.com/0cuONed96DSGJEtCjntVkxgQQzWgVT7Tx-srWEQ1BgJPT5ikW2rC-cx5aYAgGidcwHKg1GP280KoBJdSNLg0A-coy8RjbSk54BlVMCzgaB8QkTlpY7MvsYVqTvhvwNIY-fnDLNOVAsW-fxrB3o59RPY\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"533\"></figure><p>Native USDC entered the Polkadot ecosystem at the back end of Q3, but the effects of that were more fully felt in Q4 with more than $10m circulating on Polkadot Asset Hub by the end of the year (see chart above). <a href=\"https://hydradx.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HydraDX</a> led support of native USDC from Polkadot’s parachains, with an additional $2.19m in circulation.</p><h2 id=\"the-%E2%80%98great-unlock%E2%80%99-triggers-staking-surge\">The ‘Great Unlock’ triggers staking surge</h2><p>One aspect Parity’s data team looked closely at was the effect of an event known within the Polkadot community as “The Great Unlock”. During the first parachain auctions in October 2021, almost 100m DOT was locked in Acala, Moonbeam, Parallel, Astar and Clover. Those tokens were officially released on October 24th, 2023.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-eu.googleusercontent.com/nJwvEr_6niiNjdWCn3y64uPRt7nnqed-hK70a_XpEp0ajpwZWhznJnfmuS4BDaa3jvLv6Fr2W1GpzNSgmI88I68irhQYh2hpKHiTeVXeqRoq9eJQgOT9VHTy6AGt3DyorxbJM7Xh3uaBo_LvnRDf3z4\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"857\"></figure><p>At this time, the number of tokens staked was 673m DOT, a number that rose to 709m by November 30th. A bump in the chart above is visible immediately after the unlock towards the end of October, with a continual rise to the end of November.</p><p>The year ended with a little over 710m DOT staked, or 50.9% of the total DOT supply, according to the <a href=\"https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview\"><u>Polkadot Staking Dashboard</u></a>. Interest in pooled staking continues to rise steadily too, with nearly 23,000 people actively bonding in a total pool just shy of 12m DOT.</p><p>For even more data, you can see the <a href=\"https://dashboards.data.paritytech.io/reports/2023/index.html#polkadot-in-numbers\"><u>first annual report</u></a> published by Parity’s data team in December, a study packed with a wealth of written analysis and charts.</p><h2 id=\"gavin-wood%E2%80%99s-2023-review\">Gavin Wood’s 2023 Review</h2><p>Polkadot founder Gavin Wood published his <a href=\"https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadot-2023-roundup-7fe77d88f022\"><u>personal 2023 roundup</u></a> at the end of December. He observed: “The Polkadot ecosystem continues to grow: Across Polkadot and Kusama we have 90 parachains from over 580 ecosystem projects; 300 of which are decentralised applications and 190 are Substrate-based blockchains.”</p><p>He also noted the release of technical upgrades, such as Asynchronous Backing, which has rolled out on Kusama with Polkadot to follow imminently. This is a development that more than doubles parachain block production and provides a performance boost for parachains of up to 800%.</p><p>Meanwhile, Agile Coretime is going live on testnets, and is expected on Kusama and Polkadot before the end of Q1 2024. As Wood explains: “Agile Coretime fundamentally alters the means by which Polkadot’s key resource — time on parachain cores — is acquired. Rather than long-term leases with difficult-to-predict deposits arrived at by auction, instead Coretime (as the resource is called) is sold off at more predictable prices in a monthly sale just ahead of usage.”</p><h2 id=\"also-in-the-news-this-quarter\">Also in the news this quarter</h2><p><strong>Agrotoken</strong>, the first global tokenization infrastructure for agricultural commodities, announced its plans to launch a Polkadot parachain. Agrotoken is a digital platform that issues <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/newsroom/press-releases/agrotoken-polkadot\"><u>stablecoins to farmers</u></a> based on the dollar value of their crops - and they can exchange them for supplies, machinery or fuels, completing their transactions with credit and debit cards.</p><p><strong>Snowbridge</strong>, a <a href=\"https://github.com/Snowfork/snowbridge\"><u>trustless bridge</u></a> to connect Polkadot and Ethereum, is making significant strides with an imminent launch on the new Paseo testnet. The team is merging relevant pallets and support code into the Polkadot-SDK monorepo. Engineers expect full deployment to follow soon.</p><p><strong>Logion</strong>, a pioneering blockchain platform that transforms digital assets into legal-grade evidence through a unique \"<a href=\"https://logion.network/\"><u>Proof of Law</u></a>\" concept, has joined the Polkadot ecosystem by securing a parachain slot.</p><p>The <strong>Decentralized Futures</strong> program has been <a href=\"https://futures.web3.foundation/\"><u>launched</u></a>. This is a novel project aimed at supporting individuals and teams seeking to grow the Polkadot ecosystem - and the program has $20m in cash and 5m DOT tokens to distribute to successful applicants.</p>",

    "html": "<p><em>As the (northern hemisphere) nights have drawn in and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://somafm.com/christmas/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\"><em>soma.fm’s Christmas Lounge</em></a><em>&nbsp;finds its rightful place on my household radio, we once again find ourselves at the time of the year where I write my annual diary entry on behalf of Polkadot. With Covid now largely consigned to the collective memory of a generation, we see a global return to normalcy and resurgence of (in-person) events with it. Conflict and AI present some of the most prominent themes of the news cycle this year with some of the more inquisitive wondering how, along with blockchain, the world might be changed with them. This year it is also a special anniversary for me; as I write this, exactly 10 years ago I wrote the first lines of crypto-economic code in my life. So, what did 2023 bring?</em></p><h2 id=\"industrial-activity\">Industrial Activity</h2><p>As my status in this industry would, perhaps, approach that of a veteran, it seems to me that we have rather a seasonal system going. Our new “crypto-winter” has been well underway for some time now. Web3, but perhaps more accurately&nbsp;<em>cryptocurrency</em>, has found itself in the regular news rather a lot but under a somewhat more negative light than the more optimistic headlines of several years ago. (Indeed, one of the more balanced commentaries was in&nbsp;<em>The Economist</em>&nbsp;which saw fit to make a not altogether endearing comparison to that of the ancient pest, the cockroach.) This crypto-winter, while probably inevitable, must surely have been helped along by the failings of certain individuals who seem to think the messaging and marketability of Web3 can be successfully divorced from its technology and culture. I fear it’s not the last time we’ll see this behaviour in this industry, but let’s hope that this provided a constructive and enlightening lesson for everyone.</p><p>I would wager that those same headlines, and the predictable ire and criticism of the partially-informed commentators which followed, likely made their way to the halls of power. For, we also see the regulatory environment our industry finds itself in evolving, sometimes sensibly, sometimes less so. Some large developments are now happening all over the world, not least in the UK, Switzerland, Japan, the EU and the US; the latter might even be partially informed by the Web3 Foundation whose representatives have testified to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/web3foundation/web3-foundation-testifies-on-digital-asset-regulation-before-the-u-s-house-of-representatives-c0474250066\" rel=\"noopener\">the US House of Representatives</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://siliconcanals.com/news/business-wire/web3-foundation-initiates-global-roundtable-discussions-with-policy-makers-starting-in-japan/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">advised the LDP, Japan’s ruling party</a>. While the changes in these jurisdictions each have their own nuances, we are seeing an increasingly intentional position taking shape, strongly underlining the importance of avoiding trust-bound, custodial and Web2 “solutions” and bring in true trustlessness and decentralisation in all terms: stake, nodes and governance. Thankfully, some of the more enlightened regulators of the world do appear to recognise that not all cryptocurrencies are equal, even if only implicitly noted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-102.pdf\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">through certain absences</a>.</p><h2 id=\"polkadot-decentral\">Polkadot Decentral</h2><p>Those of the old guard know that decentralisation has been a priority of Polkadot through from its very conception, as mentioned in the original vision paper. It is rare for the interests of idealism and pragmatism to overlap, but in this case it is real and decentralisation is not just something we&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;work towards, but something we truly&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;deliver on.</p><p>While there is still much work to do in this industry to create truly resilient, decentralised and self-reliant systems, by many metrics Polkadot is already ahead of the game. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nakaflow.io/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">recent independent report</a>&nbsp;placed Polkadot top in terms of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nakaflow.io/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">the Nakamoto coefficient</a>&nbsp;(one means of measuring structural decentralisation) among the industry’s major networks and second out of all proof-of-stake protocols. This year also saw a decentralisation milestone hit with a second implementation,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://app.schildi.chat/#/room/#engineering-general:parity.io:~:text=Parity%20Polkadot%20Host%20%2C(-,Kagome,-)%2C%20running%20as%20a\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Kagome</a>, of the Polkadot Relay-chain protocol joining&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kusama.subscan.io/validator/GZ777psWniwVo6gJV5T1ywnEy9UsQZEehWW5zu76A3Cco3z\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">the active validator set on Kusama</a>!</p><p>It might seem that the push to decentralise is starker nowhere more so than Parity’s recent structural changes. Parity’s efforts to decentralise have meant a substantial reduction in the headcount which falls under its executive, mostly in areas involved with the support of ecosystem activity and not so much involved in areas associated with Parity’s historical domain, the development of core technology. On the back of this restructuring, the Web3 Foundation announced the launch of the impressive $55m&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futures.web3.foundation/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Decentralised Futures</a>&nbsp;fund whose stated purpose is to aid our ecosystem in its efforts to further decentralise itself and arrive in a sustainable position where activity is contributing to the utility and demand of Polkadot’s main resource,&nbsp;<em>Coretime</em>. This fund is available immediately, and has already received dozens of high quality applications and will continue to be active and disbursing over the first half of 2024.</p><p>The Polkadot ecosystem continues to grow: Across Polkadot and Kusama we have 90 parachains from over 580 ecosystem projects; 300 of which are decentralised applications and 190 are Substrate-based blockchains. Polkadot runs with 50 of its parachain cores enabled now, with 17,000 XCM messages being shuttled trustlessly and securely between them each month. On the 22nd of December, we saw the Relay-chain alone—that’s one of 50 chains on Polkadot and one which already has quite a lot of other stuff to be doing—&nbsp;<a href=\"https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">handle 6.9m transactions in 24 hours</a>, a sustained rate of 80 per second over the day. We now see almost 2,000 monthly active developers and 83,000 monthly active users across the ecosystem. We’ve seen over 10x growth of the small-hodler-friendly nomination pools through the year to over 180 pools covering 10m DOT staked.</p><p>In the Web3 Foundation’s grants programme we’ve seen 324 applications over the year of which a huge 135 have been signed over 54 countries; and last month, the foundation hit a milestone as it signed its 600th grant since the programme began in 2017.</p><h2 id=\"momentous-occasions\">Momentous Occasions</h2><p><a href=\"https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/events/decoded-2023/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Polkadot’s flagship event<u>&nbsp;</u><em>Decoded</em></a>&nbsp;took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, June this year and with satellite events around the world, not least&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dotinvietnam.com/decoded-satellite-event.html\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">in Hanoi (Vietnam</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/satellite-event-polkadot-decoded-2023-buenos-aires-tickets-661722047457\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Buenos Aires (Argentina</a>), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@OneBlockplus/highlights-of-polkadot-decoded-2023-shanghai-satellite-event-i-6554c1c48aea\" rel=\"noopener\">Shanghai (China)</a>. Across both events, 1,500 people turned up (and many thousands more tuned in) to hear from more than 100 speakers from across the ecosystem. Both were hybrid events, and for the Copenhagen event alone more than 11,000 virtual registrations were made.</p><p>Immediately prior to the Copenhagen event, the Polkadot Summit took place, a symposium of 150 of the key decision-makers and builders within the ecosystem. This, I feel was rather successful, with one key result being the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-summit-volume-3-retrospective/3584\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">introduction</a>&nbsp;of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-summit-adapting-metadata-for-hardware-wallets/3419\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">new</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/46\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">metadata schema</a>&nbsp;designed to optimise hardware wallets for trustless operation throughout the Polkadot ecosystem: Given the unprecedented levels of flexibility offered by Polkadot’s parachain model and its — again — unprecedented upgradability, the ability to describe the meaning of any given transaction at any given time is not easily achieved. Nevertheless, the integration of transaction metadata (and along with it a human-readable meaning of the transaction being signed) provides an ecosystem-wide solution capable of being rolled out to the wallet solutions across various well-known manufacturers. As we decentralise further, programmes like this ensure the ecosystem as a whole can work together to help create common opportunities in areas like standardisation, infrastructure and tooling.</p><p><a href=\"https://polkadot.network/newsroom/press-releases/sub0-polkadot-devs-returns-lisbon\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Sub0, the Polkadot Developer Conference</a>&nbsp;took place for the first time this year as a hybrid event, with all material live streamed and various facilities in place for those unable to attend in person. 500 people attended in person (with many hundreds more tuning in online) to listen to more than 50 speakers present key insights into Polkadot’s technology base. Speakers included both core developers talking about the latest developments, tooling, APIs and processes, as well as industry technologists talking about their experience of arriving at solutions through the tech stack.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.primaverasound.com/en/primavera-pro/web3-music-summit-madrid\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Web3 Music Summit</a>, organised by Primavera Sound in collaboration with the Web3 Foundation, provided a space for exploring Web3 within the context of the music industry. Of particular note was the possibility of using DAOs within the industry to rebalance and optimise the economic incentives for artists by allowing for more direct means of economic interaction between artists and fans.</p><p>There were numerous Polkadot-focussed conferences organised by and within the community including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Paris_Dot_Comm\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">ParisDOT</a>&nbsp;(in France) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.polkadotnowindia.com/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Polkadot Pulse</a>&nbsp;(in Bangalore, India), not to mention numerous Polkadot satellite events around the globe at the biggest industry gatherings such as ETHDenver, Austin’s SXSW,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRrhoGqxNBU\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Korea Blockchain Week</a>, Tokyo’s WebX, Singapore’s Token 2049, Coindesk Consensus and NYC’s Messari Mainnet with seminars, stands and side-events presenting Polkadot’s unique strengths and vibrant community of technologists.</p><h2 id=\"academic-achievements\">Academic Achievements</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Polkadot Blockchain Academy</a>, a first-of-its-kind programme to create a blockchain course worthy of being taught in world-class centres of academic excellence, proceeded to grow with its second and third cohort of students. Having started as a five week course taught in Cambridge University last year, this year it continued on a global tour, taught at the historic University of Buenos Aires at the beginning of the year and then again in the famous Berkeley campus of the University of California during summer.</p><p>Buenos Aires saw 790 applicants compete over 76 places on the course, which was conducted in collaboration with 12 universities in the wider Latin America region. The course is not for the faint of heart and with comprehensive coursework examined by some of the best minds in the industry, a pass cannot be taken for granted, though 80% of the students ultimately managed it!</p><p>In the latter course where 344 applicants applied over 72 places, we introduced a new Founders’ Track, a variation of the course focussing less on the deeply technical programming elements and more on the wider technology and its social and industrial implications. We saw a similar pass rate with one individual passing with distinction. Our youngest graduate came for the six week course all the way from Eastern Europe at the tender age of 17.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://substrate.io/ecosystem/substrate-builders-program/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Substrate Builders Programme</a>, Parity’s premier support programme for teams embarking on building a blockchain using Polkadot SDK, continued unabated, with 2023 seeing 124 projects applying to the programme and 23 projects making their first major milestone from 55 reviews. Meanwhile a sister programme launched,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://polkadot.network/development/developer-heroes/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\"><em>Developer Heroes</em></a>, focussing on mentoring individual developers within the ecosystem, saw 420 applicants throughout the year. It continues with well over 200 members and 60 mentors.</p><h2 id=\"power-to-the-parachains\">Power to the Parachains</h2><p>This year saw the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://polkadot.network/newsroom/press-releases/native-usdc-enters-polkadot-ecosystem-in-boost-for-defi-parachains\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">launch</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/560447\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">further deployment</a>&nbsp;of both major centralised stablecoins Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Hardly the panacea of decentralisation we’re working towards, these nonetheless provide some important utility for several parachain projects and users where pragmatism must take front seat. $250m of USDC alone sits on the Polkadot Asset Hub, with more in USDT contributing to the ecosystem’s stablecoin total.</p><p>Kusama’s Asset Hub now has fully integrated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-update-roadmap/1200#decentralized-exchange-3\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">direct token conversions</a>. This wonder of cross-chain magic works by introducing a system-level decentralised exchange to provide a neutral and easily accessible pool of liquidity for DOT/KSM to various tokens. Moreover, this liquidity pool is fully integrated with the fee payment system allowing all such tokens to easily be used to pay for fees on the Asset Hub and for exchanges to happen with the XCM language without needing to go through third-parties. This dramatically simplifies cross-chain transactions and reduces complexity for users, collators and developers.</p><p>Within the ecosystem, the user-tooling landscape continues to evolve with major improvements to a number of well-known products. Parity’s&nbsp;<em>Signer,&nbsp;</em>an app designed to transform any old android or iOS device into a fully-featured ultra-secure air-gapped wallet, has now been rewritten and released as the&nbsp;<em>Polkadot Vault</em>. While I’m still involved in product direction, maintenance is transitioning out of Parity to the Novasama team (expect a more substantial notification when this is finalised). It has lately received several features designed to bring tight integration to said team’s new Spektr Wallet. For those that don’t know, this is a treasury-funded and open-source project designed to be a non-commercial, neutral desktop wallet for enthusiasts and power-users. By integrating well, the amount of&nbsp;<em>faff</em>&nbsp;done on the&nbsp;<em>Vault</em>&nbsp;device is reduced to near zero and the process of&nbsp;<em>Vault&nbsp;</em>restoration and upgrading becomes a joy to behold.</p><p>This year saw the introduction of the Bridge Hub and Identity chain, which together with the Collectives chain and the Asset Hub further develops Polkadot’s system-level functionality across four system chains and moves it away from an architecture bottlenecked by the Relay-chain. The two industry-leading trustless bridges are now feature-complete and audited and are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClaraVanStaden/status/1738113676597481638?s=20\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">moving into deployment on the bridge hub(s)</a>&nbsp;with activity expected to begin shortly into the new year. The bridges are the first of their kind, using special purpose cryptographic protocols grown within the Web3 Foundation’s research team in order to provide their service in a trustless fashion. They avoid use of any special “governance” trapdoor administration body and unlike Ethereum bridges to date are not limited to token transfers, but fully integrate with XCM in order to allow for totally arbitrary contract interactions. This opens up all sorts of design space for solutions which involve straddling two sovereign networks like Ethereum and Moonbeam. Of course the bridges are still limited by the underlying security of the weaker network, but if this is a limitation you’re willing to eat up, then this is some revolutionary technology not worth missing.</p><h2 id=\"big-beats-are-the-best\">Big Beats are the Best</h2><p>2023 has seen some notable newcomers to the Polkadot ecosystem. Beatport, the music portal beloved of DJs, announced plans for blockchain integration covering NFTs with various platform integrations through their own parachain to be launched on Polkadot.</p><p>Energy Web announced their intention to transition from their current EVM-based chain to Polkadot technology. For those that do not know, Energy Web is the world’s largest ecosystem of companies using open-source, decentralised technologies and home to the blockchain projects of many major enterprises in the energy sector.</p><p>OpenZeppelin, a giant in blockchain security auditing, has been collaborating with Polkadot’s Ink! smart contracts team; it recently announced it has begun building a library of Polkadot parachain runtimes, funded by the Polkadot (on-chain) Treasury, adding another major player to help support the burgeoning number of teams building Polkadot parachains on Substrate.</p><p>Mythical Games, the number one gaming chain, announced their move to bring millions of in-game assets on to their parachain as NFTs and helping to showcase Polkadot as the scalable interoperable network of blockchains set out in the original vision paper over seven years ago.</p><h2 id=\"the-new-albumen-is-out-now\">The New Album(en) is Out Now</h2><p>This year saw the final release of Polkadot 1.0 in July signalling that the Polkadot Relay-chain is feature-complete according to said vision paper. It has been a long slog, but it’s very nice to have arrived! With the feature set delivered, focus will shift into two directions; firstly, a long-term strategic plan to pivot Polkadot into a more general platform for generating, utilizing and selling&nbsp;<em>Coretime</em>, Polkadot’s version of&nbsp;<em>blockspace</em>. Secondly, managing a near-term priority list of features, tools and fixes specifically for getting the most out of the existing Polkadot 1 platform.</p><p>Already we can see this with Polkadot 1.1, released at the end of the year, bringing with it a slew of new technology including, importantly,&nbsp;<em>Asynchronous Backing</em>&nbsp;which has already been rolled out on Kusama with Polkadot to follow imminently. Asynchronous Backing is an improvement to the parachain technology stack largely invisible to developers which introduces a form of&nbsp;<em>pipelining</em>. This allows for more than a doubling of parachain block production (going from an average of one block every 12 or so seconds to one every six) and a large improvement in the amount of work which can be done in those blocks. The upshot is a near transparent performance boost for parachains of up to 800%.</p><p>Impressive third-party infrastructure is being built to help utilise Polkadot such as the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/ChainSafe/metamask-snap-polkadot\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Metamask Snap functionality</a>&nbsp;allowing the ever-popular Metamask browser wallet to be used for Polkadot apps and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tanssi.network/post/intro-to-tanssi-appchain-infrastructure-protocol\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Tanssi appchain deployment</a>&nbsp;system for simplifying the process of, you guessed it, deploying appchains.</p><p>Another important technology whose roll-out began this year was On-Demand Parachains (<em>ODP</em>) which the Polkadot veterans might remember as&nbsp;<em>parathreads</em>, dating back to late 2018 in Shanghai. On-Demand Parachains, as the name might suggest, allows for the possibility of parachains purchasing their Coretime (that is, the Polkadot resource allowing them to be advanced securely) immediately before usage, rather than as at present with long-term rented “slots”. Alongside Agile Coretime, ODP promises to be a step change in how Polkadot’s “blockspace” can be utilised.</p><p>Polkadot 1.0 arrived alongside the fourth major revision of XCM (version three — in true computer science fashion we began at zero). This brought with it numerous important improvements for the ecosystem including the groundwork for a huge increase in secure message throughput by correctly attributing the resource costs of each instruction.</p><p>This year also saw the release of Smoldot 1.0, which now exists in proper decentralised fashion as a treasury-funded project. While experimentally integrated into the venerable Polkadot.js apps in compatibility mode, it very much comes into its own with applications built directly for it such as Novasama’s Spektr power-user wallet and alongside purpose-built middleware, of which Polkadot-API (PAPI) is shaping up to be the first functional example.</p><h2 id=\"rolling-with-it\">Rolling with it</h2><p>The Polkadot Network rolls on with its impressive rate of seamless upgrades and improvements without breakage or downtime, a first in this industry and something which owes itself not least to the Webassembly-based meta-protocol foundations and Kusama, its veritable canary network.</p><p>2023 was the year where the three major codebases of Polkadot were finally merged into a single codebase. Substrate (the general blockchain development framework, used primarily by Polkadot, but now also by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cardano-blockchain-plans-adopt-polkadots-182245214.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMaXqF-NEJT68L2GpDa025KrtbeKoSf8_XH9AmZ6fH6Li22FdLRk6F3KF_4WRXpC4H8o-_br1Q-Aircc7MVX2HDPPmihFJifJkc3kEUs9GshfysGvPesvAxD2Lb1HUYKFn4RcqDKbeQhrJ9dWPqd5KoRxBvfn_GcZN7iO4Myn7II\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Cardano’s Midnight</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MandalaChain/status/1720080267279585340\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Mandala</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/uPeterKris/status/1638603666755035151\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Polygon’s Avail</a>), Polkadot node (the Relay-chain node software, based on Substrate) and Cumulus (the software which allows parachains to be built using Substrate) are now under a single Polkadot-SDK (that’s Software Development Kit, the software used for building particular kinds of other software) codebase. This merging dramatically simplifies and streamlines development.</p><p>While this merge&nbsp;<em>per se</em>&nbsp;does nothing to help decentralise since they were and continue to be under the Parity organisation on Github anyway, further change taken this year does contribute toward decentralisation: the parts of the codebase which define the business logic specific to Polkadot and Kusama, the so-called&nbsp;<em>production runtimes</em>, are no longer hosted under the Parity Github organization; instead, these are now administered by the decentralised Polkadot Fellowship organisation (more on this below).</p><p>Secondly, the various pieces of Polkadot SDK are now released on the Rust-ecosystem software publication service crates.io, ensuring a greater degree of stability for teams building on Polkadot-SDK and reducing the reliance on Parity’s internal development processes. Further changes are planned next year to increase the SDK stability and substantially reduce the workload of ecosystem teams in keeping their codebases up to date.</p><h2 id=\"business-as-unusual\">Business as Unusual</h2><p>Frame, Substrate’s framework for building components of business logic which sits on-chain (not unlike smart contracts in many ways), has had more than its fair share of improvements over 2024. While some of them are obvious, others sit&nbsp;<em>under the hood</em>&nbsp;but are equally important, if not more so. One of the most important is the message-queuing system used for ferrying XCM messages around the ecosystem. Now ready for roll-out, this allows for a much greater number and complexity of messages to be sent between chains. There’s also the new&nbsp;<code>feeless_if</code>&nbsp;API for feeless transactions,&nbsp;<code>task</code>&nbsp;API which massively improves the DevEx for on-chain maintence functions and Default Configs, allowing pallets to have their&nbsp;<code>Config</code>&nbsp;trait items have default values. Many more improvements were made, but too many to list here!</p><p>OpenGov, the major revision of Polkadot’s governance apparatus, launched calling time for the Polkadot Council and Technical Committee and ushering in a step-change to its decentralised credentials. Indeed, we already saw the community gather and defend Polkadot from its first malicious referendum by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/18064194?tab=event\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">forcefully cancelling it</a>.</p><p>OpenGov brought with it the Polkadot Fellowship. This is an entity whose actions and membership are governed through sophisticated on-chain code, the first of its kind and one of a number of concrete steps towards Polkadot becoming a functional, self-sovereign DAO capable of attracting, retaining and developing the talent and expertise it needs to survive and prosper. At present there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/#/members\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">around 60 members</a>, with a steady inflow of individuals joining the ranks. The project’s developments are tracked in the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@TheKusamarian/opendev-polkadot-fellowship-core-dec-call-dec-2023-ceffee8a318d\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenDev monthly public call</a>&nbsp;attended by many of the fellows (myself included) and directed by Jay Chrawnna of the Kusamarian and hosted by Mangata’s Tommi Enenkel. Furthermore it is the Fellowship who administer the codebase and make the releases for the business logic (<em>runtimes</em>) of Polkadot and Kusama (though of course their governance apparatus still must actually execute any upgrades).</p><p>We’ve seen OpenGov’s (at times raucus) treasury process giving plenty of popcorn-worthy online chatter, showcasing opinionated parties competing to have their positions heard and felt. While this is instructive of functioning, inclusive democratic processes, this doesn’t always yield the most streamlined means of decision-making, nor it is ideal in attracting reasoned discourse. OpenGov is much more than this and this year, we see the unmistakable beginnings of decentralised governance and execution maturing beyond basic stake-voting into a sophisticated DAO with the materialisation of Polkadot’s Fellowship inserted as the first non-token element of Polkadot’s decision-making apparatus. Others will surely follow.</p><p>In a groundbreaking moment, the Polkadot network began what amounts to its first decentralised, autonomous sovereign wealth reserve when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/231\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">OpenGov instructed</a>&nbsp;the network to use treasury funds to make a periodic purchase of USDT to fund the Salary Programme of the Polkadot Fellowship.</p><p>Referendum #231 is using 469,000 DOT to acquire upwards of $2m worth of USDT (quite a bit more than that, as I write this) over XCM from the HydraDX Omnipool, a parachain-based high-liquidity decentralised exchange. The purchase mechanism uses the on-chain scheduler to conduct the purchase process in small amounts, averaging $250 every half-hour or so. This USDT will be placed in a special-purpose network sub-treasury to be used specifically for the autonomous disbursement to Polkadot Fellowship members as part of the Fellowship Salary Programme. The Salary Programme itself was outlined in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/0c3df46d76625980b8b48742cb86f4d8fa6dda8d/manifesto.pdf\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Manifesto</a>&nbsp;and detailed and introduced as part of Fellowship&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/50/files?short_path=0b1740c#diff-0b1740c525b5f4d411e0c5f9e2adac79bd34bf5fd9a2f30907aee0ffa5b437e0\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">RFC#50</a>.</p><p>The entire process was approved in a decentralised manner through OpenGov and is being executed autonomously and trustlessly on-chain in professionally audited logic coded according to pre-published description. No specific individual or meatspace organisation held any administrative privilege or office throughout. While this was a stablecoin token purchase to place in the Fellowship treasury, there is nothing unique about USDT, the Fellowship or its sub-treasury and the same process can be applied to any token for which a decentralised exchange exists within reach of Polkadot’s XCM, and for any treasury under any collective. Perhaps we’ll see a wealth management collective coming together to create a decentralised sovereign wealth fund for Polkadot? In any case I would expect to see a proliferation of rules-based collectives hosting their own multi-asset treasuries, perhaps with attached salary programmes to fulfil specific needs of the network in the future.</p><h2 id=\"core-blimey\">Core Blimey!</h2><p>Agile Coretime, which I first presented as an idea at Decoded this year is, after a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/1\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">swiftly written RFC</a>&nbsp;and period of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/14568\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">intense development</a>, now going live on Rococo and expected on Kusama and Polkadot in Q1 next year. This fundamentally alters the means by which Polkadot’s key resource — time on parachain cores — is acquired. Rather than long-term leases with difficult-to-predict deposits arrived at by auction, instead Coretime (as the resource is called) is sold off at more predicable prices in a monthly sale just ahead of usage.</p><p>In the Agile Coretime model, chunks of Coretime are represented by XCM NFTs, and they can be traded, exchanged, advertised and sold in much the same way as any other NFT within the Polkadot ecosystem. Moreover, these Coretime NFTs can be sliced and diced in myriad ways before these smaller bits of Coretime are resold and eventually used for powering a parachain. Already Coretime marketplaces such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lastic.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Lastic</a>&nbsp;are taking shape to provide an easy way to trade this new resource class.</p><p>Its immediate consequences are to avoid the need to lock up DOT tokens in slot auctions (and take part in the crowdloans which often capitalised them). This hugely reduces the burden on new teams and the uncertainty for current teams. It works well with the “On-Demand Parachains” model, allowing those purchasers of Coretime to contribute it to a shared pool from which ODPs can purchase as needed.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>The new year promises to be a rather busy time for Polkadot. Agile Coretime, On-Demand Parachains, Ethereum Snowbridge and the Kusama bridge are four major pieces of infrastructure imminently landing. Elastic Scaling adds a fifth technology which I’d expect to see in 2024. I can also say I’m looking forward to the expansion of our DAO primitives, between new fellowships, multi-asset sub-treasuries, expanded XCM and some exciting new primitives which we have in development.</p><p>Sassafras, our novel forkless block-production consensus algorithm, has taken shape and we can expect this to begin being used in testnets over 2024. Parity Labs is also working on a number of new technologies; a recent RFC (closed as it goes through some major iteration in the prototyping phase) known as&nbsp;<em>CoreJam</em>&nbsp;might give the interested some ideas about the direction being taken here.</p><p>This brings my little retrospective to its close; I do hope you enjoyed it. All that is left is for me to wish everyone a happy holiday season and a bit more freedom, peace and happiness in the world.</p><p>Until next year, Gav.</p>",

The program will consist of both keynotes and presentations everyone can attend, as well as smaller, more collaborative sessions.</p><p>The goal of sub0 is to connect developers with each other, offer the skills that enable builders to enhance the Polkadot ecosystem, and share best practice. To increase the chance of your proposal being accepted, please keep this in mind!</p><p>Propose a presentation, workshop, or panel discussion that unravels the complex, demystifies the abstract, or points to new possibilities. It's not just about showcasing your tech but about contributing to a communal knowledge pool.</p><p>Submissions should focus on empowering builders to code with confidence! You are encouraged to showcase the tech and involve interactive elements to engage the audience and fuel discussion. Please don’t submit proposals focused around project promotion or pitches.</p><p>If you're not ready to delivery your own presentation, you could also use the same form to <strong>nominate a speaker</strong> you'd love to hear from. And if you just want to purchase discounted tickets for the event, then stay tuned for further updates!</p><h3 id=\"tracks\"><strong>Tracks</strong></h3><p>At sub0 Asia 2024, there will be two separate tracks: a Builder Space and a Starter Space.</p><p>The <strong>Starter Space</strong> content should be tailored for those new to Substrate, the Polkadot ecosystem, and blockchain technology in general. Proposals for the Starter Space should focus on topics like the greater Web3 vision, introductions to specific concepts and protocols like <a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/blog/xcm-v3-breaking-new-ground-for-web3-interoperability/?ref=cms.polkadot.network\"><u>XCM</u></a> or CAPI, and the best ways to get started building with Substrate (e.g. the Substrate Builders program). Workshops in this track could focus on a range of themes, such as everything about ink!, deployment of Polkadot and parachain testnets on Kubernetes and how to build an attestation service for digital assets. This space is designed for those new to the Polkadot tech stack to walk away with a clear understanding of the ecosystem.</p><p>The <strong>Builder Space</strong> track will be more suitable for the experienced Polkadot and <a href=\"https://substrate.io/?ref=cms.polkadot.network\"><u>Substrate</u></a> builders, who are ready to dive deeper into technical content and workshops. The topics could range from light clients, divorcing relay and parachain nodes in the collator, and BEEFY. Speakers could aslo cover a more technical roadmap for where the Polkadot tech stack is heading. This space is for builders who already have experience with the Polkadot tech stack to examine technical topics in detail, build during workshops, see new blockchain SDK tools, and hear about the latest developments on Polkadot and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"presentation-formats\"><strong>Presentation Formats</strong></h3><p>When submitting your proposal, we ask that you specify the presentation format. You can choose from the following formats, regardless of the track you are applying for:</p><p><strong>Tech Talk (25 minutes) </strong>- A focused exploration of the technology of Polkadot and/or Substrate. Depending on the track they are intended for, proposals should either aim to bring new builders into the ecosystem or provide fresh insights to those already familiar with the technology. Tech Talk proposals must include a link to your project's Github repo.</p><p><strong>Workshop (50 minutes)</strong> - A technical workshop demonstrating the inner workings of Substrate and/or the Polkadot tech stack. Workshop proposals should include an outline of what your educational goals are, i.e the outcome you want your audience to achieve after attending your workshop. Please also make sure to provide a link to the GitHub repo you will be using during the workshop.</p><p><strong>Live Demo (25 minutes)</strong> - A live demonstration showcasing the unique possibilities of Polkadot and/or Substrate. Live Demo proposals must include a link to your project's Github repo.</p><p><strong>Innovators Round Table (50 minutes)</strong> - A session for highlighting a specific topic or obstacle you have confronted while innovating with Polkadot and/or Substrate. The first half of this session should explain the use case you were tackling, your development journey, and the end result. The second half will be a Q&amp;A format where attendees can share their experience, giving you the chance to advise and help alleviate their journey.</p><p><strong>Builders AMA (25 minutes)</strong> - A platform for builders to share their expertise and connect with their peers. When submitting, please specify your area of expertise within the Polkadot tech stack and provide link(s) to a live project showcasing those expertise. Within the Builders AMA sessions, attendees will be able to ask you about your expertise and your project use case in an open forum format.</p><p><strong>Nomination</strong> - If there's a speaker or subject in the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem you would like to hear from at sub0 Asia 2024 please also nominate them here. We will reach out to these speakers to gauge their interest in speaking at the event and will evaluate these submissions alongside our Call for Speaker submissions.</p><h3 id=\"selection-process\"><strong>Selection Process</strong></h3><p>All proposals will be reviewed by an advisory board consisting of members of Parity Technologies’ Engineering team, Developer Relations team, and Marketing team. With the guidance of the advisory board, Parity’s Events team will be able to curate an agenda that showcases the best of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>At the heart of sub0, it's the people like you, the builders, innovators, and forward-thinkers, who make this event a hub for learning and growth.</p><p>Don’t miss out on this opportunity to share what you’ve been working on, engage with the Polkadot developer community, and help others innovate without boundaries. <a href=\"https://app-eu.sessionboard.com/submit/sub0-2024-asia/8a49f211-2b81-481b-98da-3c92448f375e\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Submit your proposal now.</a> But remember you only have until January 4th to do so, so don't delay!</p>",

    "html": "<p>Around two years ago, the first Polkadot <a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/features/parachains/\">parachain</a> slots were secured with the help of <a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/features/auctions/\">crowdloans</a>, a way for DOT holders to support their favorite parachain projects and get rewarded in return, typically with the project’s native token. With the two-year lease period for Polkadot’s first parachains now coming to a close, early crowdloan contributors are set to have their DOT contributions unlocked and free for use.&nbsp;</p><p>With this in mind, and as crowdloan contributors consider what to do with their newly unlocked DOT, let’s take a look at token utility and the different ways DOT can be used in the Polkadot ecosystem. From helping secure Polkadot’s Nominated-Proof-of-Stake (<a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-consensus-part-1-enhanced-economic-security-via-npos/\">NPoS</a>) system to participating in governance, dapps, and crowdloans, Polkadot’s native token has a number of uses that support the network and offer benefits in return.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/10/DOT-uses--2-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/DOT-uses--2-.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/DOT-uses--2-.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/DOT-uses--2-.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/10/DOT-uses--2-.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Four common uses for DOT. *Solutions are currently under development to enable easy use of DOT across all ecosystem dapps</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"staking\">Staking</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/features/staking/\">Staking DOT natively</a> serves a dual purpose: it helps protect Polkadot from malicious attacks while also supporting the network’s decentralization. Staking on Polkadot also enables DOT holders to collect staking rewards for their service of helping secure the network.&nbsp;</p><p>Stakers in Polkadot’s NPoS system are called nominators because they nominate validators to secure the network. Validators play a more technical role of securing the network and participating in consensus and block production.</p><p>There are several ways to stake on Polkadot. Native staking, which means staking directly on Polkadot without going through an intermediary, enables you to stay in full control of your DOT and has benefits for the network in terms of security and decentralization. The easiest way to stake natively is to join a nomination pool. DOT holders can join a nomination pool with as little as 1 DOT, and get a more passive staking experience, as they don’t need to select their own validators, monitor validator performance, or regularly update their nominations.</p><p>Alternatively, more advanced stakers can nominate directly by selecting their own list of up to 16 validators. This method requires a bit more active engagement, as nominators should research validators, monitor their performance, and periodically update their nominations. Nominating on Polkadot is not without risk, as nominators can lose a portion of their DOT tokens via <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-validator-payout#slashing\">slashing</a> if they select a malicious validator.&nbsp;</p><p>Direct nominators also need to make sure they stake more tokens than the minimum amount required to be an active nominator and receive rewards. This amount is currently around 450 DOT and increases as participation in staking increases. Nominators who are confident in their ability to select trustworthy validators can also <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-staking-pools\">open their own nomination pool</a> and allow others to join.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview\">Polkadot’s Staking Dashboard</a> is an easy way to start nominating, directly or by nomination pool. The dashboard supports several Polkadot wallets and provides a simple interface where nominators can manage their nominations, join pools, and optimize their staking rewards. Tutorials for the staking dashboard can be found <a href=\"https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000182104-how-to-use-the-staking-dashboard-overview\">here</a>.</p><p>Several Polkadot wallets also support staking, including <a href=\"https://novawallet.io/\">Nova Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.talisman.xyz/\">Talisman</a>, <a href=\"https://fearlesswallet.io/\">Fearless Wallet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.subwallet.app/\">SubWallet</a>. For an overview of Polkadot wallets and their included features, visit the <a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/ecosystem/wallets/\">Polkadot wallets page</a>. Cold/hardware wallets are recommended for the highest level of security; hardware wallets currently supported are <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ledger\">Ledger</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-vault\">Polkadot Vault</a>.</p><p>Several other staking options exist beyond native staking, including staking via third-party custodial services and exchanges. Some Polkadot parachains, including Bifrost, Acala, and Equilibrium, also offer liquid staking features that offer additional capabilities to stakers. DOT holders are recommended to thoroughly research third-party custodial and liquid staking services before participating, as they involve different risks than native staking.</p><h2 id=\"participating-in-governance\">Participating in governance</h2><p>Polkadot's <a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/features/opengov/\">OpenGov</a> is perhaps the most advanced governance system in Web3. Launched earlier in 2023, it allows anyone with DOT to propose or vote on referenda, and brings greater decentralization than Polkadot’s previous governance system. Along with NPoS, OpenGov is one of the Polkadot features that make it among the most decentralized networks in Web3.</p><p>OpenGov provides significant advantages compared with other networks: multiple referenda can run simultaneously, meaning changes can be deployed more rapidly (or in the case of a request for Treasury funds, tokens can be released faster). “Conviction voting” - locking tokens up for longer - helps level the playing field for those with fewer tokens.</p><p>DOT holders are encouraged to participate in OpenGov and make their voices heard. Learn about how to participate on the <a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/features/opengov/\">OpenGov page</a> and the <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-polkadot-opengov\">Polkadot wiki</a>, and learn how the Treasury works <a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/ecosystem/treasury/\">here</a>. Governance proposals are discussed and voted on via governance interfaces such as <a href=\"https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/opengov\">Polkassembly</a> and <a href=\"https://polkadot.subsquare.io/\">Subsquare</a>. Those who don’t have the time or desire to participate actively in governance can delegate their voting power to someone to vote on their behalf. Learn about vote delegation <a href=\"https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000184123-polkadot-opengov-how-to-delegate-your-voting-power\">here</a> and try it out via the <a href=\"https://delegation.polkadot.network/\">delegation dashboard</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Several resources exist to keep up to date on governance discussions, including <a href=\"https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/opengov\">Polkassembly</a> and community channels such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtyd7v_I7PGkXbJmKojrZ1KXwspR1JkpV\">The Kusamarian</a>, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReferendRoundup\">Referendum Roundup</a>, and <a href=\"https://newsletter.dotleap.com/\">DotLeap</a>.</p><h2 id=\"using-dot-with-polkadot-applications\">Using DOT with Polkadot applications</h2><p>Polkadot is a rich ecosystem with hundreds of diverse dapps and projects. These cover a wide gamut of use cases, such as gaming, NFTs, DeFi, privacy, smart contracts, ID, data, storage, sustainability, social media and IoT.</p><p>Many of the dapps that users may wish to explore support participation via DOT, while others will require using parachain native tokens. Solutions are currently under development to seamlessly use DOT for all ecosystem applications. As always, DOT holders should conduct thorough research before using any applications as they may carry their own risks. To see what dapps are live in the ecosystem, check out this <a href=\"https://dotinsights.subwallet.app/projects/\">ecosystem page</a>.</p><h2 id=\"participating-in-crowdloans\">Participating in Crowdloans</h2><p>While the crowdloan model is expected to eventually be phased out with the development of <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-direction#from-slot-auctions-to-coretime-marketplace\">new, more agile ways to allocate Polkadot’s compute resources</a>, some projects may still be conducting crowdloans in the near future that DOT holders can participate in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Joining crowdloans is a way of supporting early-stage parachains, enabling a much lower barrier of entry than would otherwise be the case. Contributing to a crowdloan involves locking DOT tokens for up to two years (the duration of the parachain’s lease). Parachain teams choose how to reward their contributors for joining their communities, though typically they do this with a portion of their native token. After the parachain’s lease expires (typically two years) all DOT from contributors is unlocked and once again free for use in staking, governance, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s important to note that crowdloan participation may involve different risks than other uses of DOT such as staking, as market conditions can change greatly during the period that crowdloan contributions are locked.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/features/dot-token/\">DOT</a> is the primary tool for people to interact with, secure, and coordinate the Polkadot network, and has many uses across the ecosystem. Future developments may also bring additional uses for DOT, such as purchases of <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-direction#from-slot-auctions-to-coretime-marketplace\">coretime</a> as part of ongoing proposals for Polkadot’s future roadmap. These and any future upgrades will need to be approved by OpenGov. As a DOT holder, Polkadot gives you a say in how the network is run, giving you an active role in the movement for a better web.&nbsp;</p>",

    "published_at": "2023-09-28 13:26:33",
    "html": "<p>The vast majority of people are used to identifying assets by name or symbol, like “Tether” or “USDT”. If you’ve been around Ethereum for any length of time, you are probably used to <em>zero-ex</em> contract addresses. Then Polkadot’s Asset Hub hosted asset functionality directly in-protocol, with simple integers as asset IDs. “1984”, cheeky naming aside, is certainly easier for humans to remember (and verify) than 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7. And now Polkadot has another parallel instance of this asset functionality, except that this instance identifies assets by an XCM primitive called a “multilocation”.</p><p>In writing this explainer, I hope to convey that this opens up expressive and powerful patterns for asset utilization within the Polkadot network and anywhere reachable from it.</p><h2 id=\"local-and-foreign-assets\">Local and foreign assets</h2><p>When the Asset Hub first launched, it only hosted one instance of the Assets pallet that allowed anyone to claim an available asset ID and create their asset. Rather than a custom contract for each asset, Asset Hub has embedded asset logic that treats them as first class primitives. Every asset has the same functionality.</p><p>These assets with claimable, integer-based asset IDs, are called “local assets”. Asset Hub functioned primarily for the creators of these assets, often reserve-backed stablecoins like USDT. However, the protocol only enforces uniqueness of the asset ID (in this case, an integer). The creator can set metadata like the asset symbol. Therefore, users still have some due diligence to perform on their assets; anyone can call their asset USDT, but the user probably wants the one created by Tether.</p><p>The Asset Hub serves as the “management portal” for the asset creator, allowing them to mint and burn tokens and get an overview of their total issuance in the entire Polkadot network, including those tokens that have been sent to other locations in the network.</p><p>But the asset ID itself is not very expressive. Although easier to verify than a contract address, the ID does not tell the user anything about the asset. Enter, XCM.</p><p>Multilocations express relative paths. They are relative in that they depend on the location of interpretation. “How do I get to the supermarket” will have different directions depending on the starting position. At the most basic level, these paths express directions to other chains. But they can express directions to just about anything: an asset, a contract, a pallet index, a governing body, an account, etc.</p><p>Multilocations have a series of junctions, typically expressed in two parts: first, a number of “parents” and second, a path to follow from there. An example of a multilocation is “parents: 1, interior: Parachain(9,000)”. This says, “go to my parent, and from there go to Parachain 9,000”. A “parent” in this context is a containing consensus system. For example, the Relay Chain is the containing consensus system of parachains. A parachain could be the containing consensus system of a smart contract. It would make sense that, in this example, the multilocation is from another parachain, say the Asset Hub. Parachain 9,000 would be a sibling, since they both share the same parent, namely, the Relay Chain.</p><p>As asset identifiers, multilocations proffer significant advantages over absolute (e.g. address, hash, integer) identifiers. Primarily, an asset’s multilocation itself identifies the controlling entity. In the above example, that would be the governance of Parachain 9,000. When looking at absolute identifiers, the user must trust the issuing entity and its claims, for example that the on-chain tokens are backed in one-to-one correspondence with off-chain assets. The multilocation, terminating at a parachain, smart contract, or other protocol actually indicates the logic that controls the asset. That does not absolve the user of all necessary diligence, perhaps for example Parachain 9,000 has a trusted “superuser”. But the multilocation tells the user that this asset is controlled by a protocol, and which one.</p><p>Beyond the terminus of the multilocation, it actually makes explicit a “chain of command”. Take a longer example, say an asset with ID 42 within a pallet on parachain 9,000 – “parents: 1, interior: Parachain(9,000), PalletIndex(99), GeneralIndex(42)”. This asset is controlled by the pallet, which is within the consensus of the parachain, which is within the consensus of a shared parent (the Relay Chain). Multilocations can even express entirely foreign consensus systems, for example, “parents: 2, interior: GlobalConsensus(Ethereum)”. From a parachain’s perspective, this would say, “go up two levels (as in, one <em>above</em> the Relay Chain) and then go into Ethereum’s consensus”.</p><p>Note that these locations are very similar to Unix file paths, e.g. “../Parachain(9000)/PalletIndex(99)/GeneralIndex(42)” or “../../GlobalConsensus(Ethereum)”.</p><p>The net result is that Polkadot’s Asset Hub can represent any asset that is <em>reachable</em> from Polkadot. Whether by local pallet or contract calls, XCMP, or by bridge, whether protocol native token or local asset from another chain, the Asset Hub provides a common interface for all where an asset’s identifier actually tells you its sovereign location.</p><h2 id=\"relationships\">Relationships</h2><p>The XCM language has two ways of expressing asset transfer relationships for a location/asset pair: teleports and reserves. These define the relationships that Asset Hub has with other chains and how they interact.</p><p>Teleports are simple. When two chains trust each other with a given asset, the sender can simply destroy it and issue an instruction to the receiver to mint it. As long as the sender trusts that the receiver will not mint more than it has been sent, the sender can accept the same teleport instruction in return.</p><p>Reserves are more complicated. When the chain from which the asset originates does not trust another chain, it can place an asset into the destination chain’s sovereign account locally and send a message to the destination chain that it has credited its local account with the assets. The destination chain can then mint derivative assets for its users. When it’s done with the assets, the destination chain can send a message back to instruct the originating chain to move the assets out of its account (presumably it has destroyed the corresponding derivative issuance).</p><p>The trust in the reserve scenario is one-way. The chain minting derivative assets trusts the issuing chain to maintain its sovereign account balance and respect redemptions. But the issuing chain does not trust the chain where those assets are going to handle them faithfully.</p><p>An important note here is that the trust relationship exists for a location/asset <em>pair:</em> That is, a chain can trust another chain as a teleporter for some assets but not for others.</p><p>So, who trusts whom? And with what? Entities always trust their “parent” in the multilocation paradigm. For example, a smart contract on Parachain 8,000 trusts the governance of Parachain 8,000, which trusts the Polkadot Relay Chain. The Polkadot Relay Chain is governed by the “root origin”, which can execute any instruction, including kicking out a parachain. Polkadot’s root origin also governs all of its system parachains (in fact, the Relay Chain plus all system parachains could be thought of as the singular “Polkadot protocol”).</p><p>All chains and sub-protocols (e.g. smart contracts) in the Polkadot network trust the Polkadot protocol, so they should be fine to teleport assets with it. In fact, using reserves would be downright silly: If the Polkadot protocol did not like its reserve balance on the originating chain, it could, via root origin referendum, just overwrite the balance to something it prefers.</p><p>The Polkadot protocol, on the other hand, cannot extend such universal trust to the members within it. But it can trust a location to manage the assets that originate from that location. It can trust Parachain 9,000 with its native token (PNT, “pints”?) and assets created within it, for example tokens issued locally. Therefore, when interacting with Parachain 9,000, Asset Hub would teleport PNT, respecting that PNT originates from that parachain. But, still with Parachain 9,000, Asset Hub would use reserve transfers for PET (Parachain 8,000’s token, pronunciation less ambiguous).</p><h2 id=\"choosing-reserve-locations\">Choosing reserve locations</h2><p>The creation of PET is under the governance of Parachain 8,000, which accepts the governance of the Polkadot protocol. Therefore, Polkadot naturally trusts Parachain 8,000 with PET because PET forms part of the Parachain 8,000 protocol. But neither Polkadot nor Parachain 8,000 trust any other parachain* to act as a reserve location for PET.</p><p>(*Sidenote: Although they could. Parachain 8,000 might have other siblings that respect its governance origins, much like many system chains respect the Polkadot OpenGov origins. In this regard, it’s better to consider sovereign systems, which could comprise multiple chains, rather than individual chains.)</p><p>This concept continues down the <em>chain of command, </em>to other assets created within Parachain 8,000. In fact, it has nothing to do with separate chains or asynchrony; two smart contracts on the same chain may not trust each other to manage each other’s assets, but they both trust the chain they exist within.</p><p>Given this bidirectional trust relationship, Asset Hub can act as a reserve location for assets that were teleported to it. Parachain 8,000 can teleport its PET to the Asset Hub, which can then act as a reserve location for transfers to and amongst other locations. Meaning, Parachain 9,000 can use Asset Hub for its reserve of PET to send to other parachains.</p><p>But these other locations now could see both Parachain 8,000 and the Asset Hub as reserve locations of PET.</p><p>In practice, protocols (parachains, smart contracts, etc.) that want to use Asset Hub in this way will need to manage the idea of multiple reserve locations for given assets. Pragmatically, it probably means choosing one reserve location for each asset. Common agreements and standards amongst parachains and other protocols will likewise simplify their interactions.</p><p>With thousands of protocols in the Polkadot network, establishing communication channels with all of them is unwieldy, undesirable, or impractical. Just because one protocol does not want channels with every other protocol, it may still want free access to assets. And because Asset Hub can represent and act as a reserve location for any asset <em>reachable from</em>, not just <em>within,</em> the Polkadot network, the Asset Hub can serve as a single reserve location from which a protocol can manage and interact with a virtually unlimited number of assets.</p><h2 id=\"in-practice\">In practice</h2><p>Let’s look at an example of how to write an XCM program that will teleport a parachain’s asset to Asset Hub. Two things should stand out to developers who want to add this logic to their parachain. First, that XCM program execution occurs from the perspective of the executor instance, not the program’s origin. This means that applications should send programs that reference assets and locations from the perspective of Asset Hub.</p><p>Second, paying fees may not be trivial. When teleporting DOT between system chains or using reserve-based instructions for chains that have DOT on their sovereign account, those applications can use the asset they are transacting in for fee payment. However, Asset Hub may not accept an application’s asset for fee payment, so the program needs to pay for fees in an acceptable asset. The addition of Asset Conversion will make this simpler and more flexible, but a chain will still need to initiate the pairs that enable fee payment.</p><p>Start our program by defining some assets, namely DOT and the native asset of parachain 9,000 (PINTs), as well as a beneficiary to receive the assets:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust\">// Define the native asset, from Asset Hub's point of view.\nlet dot = MultiAsset {\n\tid: AssetId::Concrete(MultiLocation::parent()),\n\tfun: Fungibility::Fungible(10_000_000_000), // 1 DOT\n};\n\n// The location of parachain 9,000 from Asset Hub's perspective. From a parachain's\n// perspective it would probably reference its native asset and reanchor.\nlet para_nine_thousand = MultiLocation::new(1, Parachain(9000));\nlet hundred_pints = MultiAsset {\n\tid: AssetId::Concrete(para_nine_thousand),\n\tfun: Fungibility::Fungible(100),\n};\n\n// The beneficiary where we want all assets to go. Namely, the sender must specify the\n// `AccountId` where they want to deposit the assets (`target_account`).\nlet beneficiary = MultiLocation {\n\tparents: 0,\n\tinterior: X1(AccountId32 { network: None, id: target_account.into() }),\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Before constructing the program to send to Asset Hub, the sender will need to account for the assets they are teleporting. A chain could also configure its XCM Executor to handle this more gracefully.</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust\">let assets: MultiAssets = hundred_pints.into();\nlet mut local_program_to_execute: Xcm&lt;&lt;T as frame_system::Config&gt;::RuntimeCall&gt; = Xcm(vec![\n\t// Withdraw the asset (PINTs) that you're teleporting.\n\tWithdrawAsset(assets.clone()),\n\t// Use the local default asset to pay for execution fees.\n\tSetFeesMode { jit_withdraw: true },\n\t// Burn the PINTs you are teleporting.\n\tBurnAsset(assets),\n\t// Withdraw and burn the DOT used for fees. The asset used here depends on how your\n\t// local chain represents reserve-backed DOT.\n\tWithdrawAsset(/* local representation of DOT */),\n\tBurnAsset(/* local representation of DOT */),\n]);\nlet outcome = T::XcmExecutor::execute_xcm_in_credit(local_program_to_execute, ..);\noutcome.clone().ensure_complete().map_err(|_| Error::&lt;T&gt;::FailedToExecute)?;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, move on to constructing the XCM program to send to Asset Hub:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust\">// Finally, construct the XCM program to send to Asset Hub.\nlet xcm_to_send = Xcm(vec![\n\t// Withdraw DOT from the sender's sovereign account. The user should have to pay\n\t// for this on the sending side, and your parachain needs to keep its sovereign\n\t// account topped up.\n\tWithdrawAsset(dot.clone().into()),\n\t// Buy some execution with this.\n\tBuyExecution { fees: dot.into(), weight_limit: Unlimited },\n\t// Now we can receive the teleported foreign asset.\n\tReceiveTeleportedAsset(hundred_pints.into()),\n\t// Refund any weight surplus.\n\tRefundSurplus,\n\t// Deposit PINTs and remaining DOT to the same beneficiary.\n\tDepositAsset { assets: AllCounted(2).into(), beneficiary },\n]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This program will withdraw DOT from the <em>parachain’s</em> sovereign account, use this DOT to buy the weight needed to execute this program, receive the teleported PINTs, refund any unused weight, and finally deposit both assets (any change from the DOT withdrawn plus the PINTs) into the beneficiary account.</p><p>Remember that the sender probably has some accounting to do prior to sending this message. This type of program construction should also not be directly available to users, but rather behind extrinsics with proper checks in place. Almost certainly, the sender is not a trusted teleporter of DOT, otherwise they would teleport both assets and probably would not have DOT in their sovereign account to withdraw from. Meaning, they probably have a derivative, reserve-backed DOT on their local chain. Withdrawing this DOT from their sovereign account and moving it into fee payment and a beneficiary will reduce their reserves. Therefore, the sender should burn this reserve-backed representation prior to sending this message lest its chain not have full collateral in the reserve. The sender could debit it from the user who initiates the teleport, or keep its own treasury of DOT to draw from (occasionally topping up its reserves). For a more complete example, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/trappist/pull/266\">accounting done in Trappist</a>.</p><h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2><p>The addition of foreign assets to Asset Hub introduces new paradigms like multilocations as asset identifiers and multiple reserve locations, but these allow expressive and convenient interactions within the network.</p><p>Parity will be releasing more examples and tutorials in the coming months to demonstrate some common patterns of working with foreign assets. Parachain developers should keep an eye on Trappist on Rococo and wallet/integration developers should look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api\">Asset Transfer API</a>.</p><p>For the brave, Rococo’s, Kusama’s, and Polkadot’s Asset Hubs already support foreign assets, so you can get to work developing.</p>",

    "html": "<p>Polkadot’s ongoing mission to unlock the full potential of Web3 has seen several milestones so far in 2023. With the <a href=\"https://www.polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-1-0-pioneering-blockspace-composability-and-scalability/\">recent official release of the completed version of Polkadot 1.0</a>, inclusive of all the functionality outlined in the Polkadot whitepaper, the next stages of increasing network scalability are now being developed.</p><p>Access to high-quality blockspace is crucial for a diverse next-gen blockspace ecosystem like Polkadot. Asynchronous backing is the latest step in the roadmap towards natively scaling Polkadot’s performance and flexibility for Web3 use cases across every industry. As the first set of major optimizations to parachain consensus protocol since its launch in 2021, asynchronous backing will provide a key performance boost to the network, benefiting everyone from parachain and dapp builders to end users, and also lays the groundwork for future scaling optimizations.</p><h2 id=\"the-importance-of-asynchronous-backing\">The importance of asynchronous backing</h2><p>To explore the impact that asynchronous backing can have for parachains and their end users, it's important to understand the current process for block execution on Polkadot. Every parachain block references a Relay Chain block as an anchor, referred to as the Relay Chain Parent. Historically, only parachain blocks using the most recent Relay Chain block as its Relay Chain Parent have been allowed. This synchronization can limit throughput, as it provides only a short window of time for creating the next parachain block. Also, since proposing a parachain candidate currently requires building off ancestors that have been backed already, parachain blocks can only be proposed every other Relay Chain block. These limitations slow down throughput even more and can lead to congestion.</p><p>Asynchronous backing represents a marked optimization of Polkadot’s parachain consensus protocol. Unlike synchronous backing, which requires building blocks on the most recent Relay Chain block, asynchronous backing loosens this constraint — de-synchronizing Relay Chain growth from parachain growth — and allows collators to propose parachain blocks using older Relay Chain parents. This enables collators to create pipelines of multiple parachain blocks that haven't yet been included in the Relay Chain, increasing efficiency and scalability. What’s more, as collators can propose parachain candidates off ancestors that haven’t been backed yet, blocks can be proposed every Relay Chain block.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-look-like-in-operation\">What does this look like in operation?</h2><p>Asynchronous backing directly improves block capacity by increasing block execution time and parablock time, which in turn increase the amount of work every parachain can achieve.</p><p><strong>Execution time</strong><br>This refers to the time available for a specific operation, such as validating blocks, to be completed. Asynchronous backing increases execution time from 500ms to 2s, leading to a 4x improvement in blockspace production.<br><br><strong>Parablock time</strong><br>This refers to the interval between consecutive parachain blocks. Asynchronous backing reduces parablock time from 12s to 6s, leading to an additional 2x increase in throughput.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image2-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image2-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/image2-1.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/image2-1.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image2-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Increasing the execution time and halving the parachain block time would lead to a theoretical 8x improvement in parachain throughput</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"asynchronous-backing-in-polkadot%E2%80%99s-broader-scaling-roadmap\">Asynchronous backing in Polkadot’s broader scaling roadmap</h2><p>Asynchronous backing will lead to immediate results for Polkadot, its parachains, and their users. What’s more, it's a foundational capability providing blockspace utilization and scaling improvements that set the stage for broader capabilities in the future.</p><p>One set of capabilities that asynchronous backing will make possible is agile coretime, a part of Polkadot’s proposed roadmap designed to allocate blockspace in a more flexible and cost-efficient way (as laid out in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhC10CCw9Qg\">this talk</a> at Polkadot Decoded 2023).</p><p><strong>Short-term</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Parachain throughput increase: </strong>Individual parachains can increase their blockspace production by enabling collators to efficiently propose and process more transactions in a given time frame.</li><li><strong>Minimum parachain latency reduction: </strong>Parachain blocks can be created and processed more frequently with asynchronous backing. With more transactions being processed in less time, overall user experience is enhanced.</li></ul><p><strong>Mid-term</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Flexible scheduling of parachain blocks: </strong>Due to the creation of pipelines of parachain blocks, blockspace can be scheduled more flexibly, which lays the groundwork for most of the future features on the scaling roadmap.</li><li><strong>Ability to buy blockspace with instantaneous and bulk options: </strong>Agile coretime capabilities will allow the accommodation of both low frequency and high frequency blockspace demand, ensuring that the network can seamlessly scale to meet the needs of various applications. With instantaneous coretime, blockspace can be purchased on a pay-as-you-go basis, whereas bulk options may be purchased in blocks over a given timeframe.</li></ul><p><strong>Long-term</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Elastic scaling</strong>: Blockspace demand for applications will have peaks and valleys.  The peaks of demand can be served by acquiring blockspace through instantaneous coretime to meet periods of peak demand, and the more predictable demand can be met with acquired blockspace and bulk coretime previously purchased.</li><li><strong>Increasing core utilization: </strong>Further improvements to optimize core utilization are on the roadmap and include the sharing or splitting of cores.</li><li><strong>Secondary markets: </strong>Secondary markets, enabled by agile coretime, will allow parachains to buy and sell blockspace that was previously purchased from the Relay Chain.</li></ul><h2 id=\"how-will-asynchronous-backing-be-deployed\">How will asynchronous backing be deployed?</h2><p>Asynchronous backing will be rolled out in phases. An initial anticipated deployment on the Versi and Rococo testnets will allow for in-depth functionality testing to ensure stability. After that, it will be proposed to Polkadot’s on-chain governance system to be voted on by the wider community. If the governance proposal passes, asynchronous backing will go live on Kusama, before finally passing to Polkadot for full deployment.</p><p>What does this mean for ecosystem teams on Polkadot? A collator guide will be published soon on the <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/\">Polkadot Wiki</a> and sent to the parachain teams, containing all necessary instructions for seamless integration of asynchronous backing functionality.</p><h2 id=\"putting-it-all-together\">Putting it all together</h2><p>Asynchronous backing establishes a major step towards natively maximizing blockspace production. As Web3 projects continue to grow in scope across industries, this guarantee of access to blockspace, without sacrificing security or trust assumptions, will be a critical consideration for technical and non-technical founders looking for an appropriate blockspace ecosystem to build within.</p><p>The boost in transaction throughput and reduction in latency will allow for improved performance, thus reducing cost and enhancing UX for users of parachain dapps. Furthermore, by providing the ability to build pipelines of parachain blocks, Polkadot is laying the foundation for future scaling capabilities.</p><p>Asynchronous backing on Polkadot is a considered solution that targets the long-running problem of blockspace congestion, lack of flexibility, and the security compromises that scalability solutions to-date have been associated with. Now, Polkadot can dynamically adapt to varying workloads for dynamic Web3 projects and simultaneously achieve higher levels of efficiency — all while ensuring the same security and trust assumptions as for the entire Polkadot ecosystem.</p><hr><p>Author: John Murray</p><p>Special thanks to Robert Habermeier, Sophia Gold, and Natalie Tillack for their contributions to this blog.</p>",

    "html": "<p>The Web3 landscape's most robust and vibrant ecosystems are those that embody true decentralization. In this trustless environment, power is distributed among multiple participants, eliminating any single point of vulnerability. These qualities make blockchain networks more resilient and secure to security threats and malicious activities, which is essential for creating long-term viability and success for projects built on them.</p><p>The Polkadot ecosystem thrives within this environment, thanks to its novel design elements, including its patented NPoS (Nominated Proof of Stake) system.</p><p>Consensus mechanisms are one of the most essential components of a decentralized network. These mechanisms help streamline decision-making and enhance the blockchain network's overall dependability. Their main job is to ensure that everyone in a network agrees on various topics, from block creation to incentive structures and more. In the context of blockchain networks, they are essential for carefully confirming and validating transactions, which safeguards the network's security, reliability, and immutability. There are many varieties of consensus systems based on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithms.</p><p>PoS requires that network participants stake their tokens as a means of supporting blockchain operations. Its original goal was to provide an alternative to PoW, which is energy-intensive, inefficient when it comes to fees, and limited in its scalability. By providing the same level of security at lower rates and with a much higher bandwidth, PoS aims to improve on these aspects. While Ethereum and other blockchains have been slowly transitioning to PoS, Polkadot already launched with PoS consensus, and later evolved to its <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190058581A1/en\">patented NPoS system</a>, which has many advantages over PoS.</p><p>The first installment in the NPoS series describes how Polkadot maintains a more secure, open and more decentralized network due to its novel consensus system, NPoS.

It comprises two main actors: nominators and validators. </p><p><strong>Nominators</strong><br>Polkadot ecosystem nominators are relatively passive participants, which means they contribute to network health and security indirectly. Nominators have two tasks to accomplish: selecting a responsible validator and adding tokens to the voting pool. As a result of appointing their stake, they can elect validators and share the rewards.</p><p>Participating as a Polkadot nominator is straightforward via the <a href=\"https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview?utm_source=polkadot.network&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=system%20parachains&amp;utm_content=blog\">Staking Dashboard</a>.</p><p>Although nominators are not required to run their own nodes or worry about online uptime, they are expected to do their due diligence on the validators they select. In addition, when nominating validators, nominators should pay attention to their reward percentage and risk losing out if their validator gets slashed.</p><p><strong>Validators</strong><br>A validator is a staking provider, and is an active member of the network. They distribute rewards among the nominees, who in turn, benefit from digital assets by voting for their chosen validator. Not only is it valuable to increase the number of validators but also enabling and increasing the number of nominators that \"vote\" on the validators without having to run the whole infrastructure. This is a great advantage of PoS consensus such as Polkadot NPoS that features nominators.</p><p>Polkadot takes proactive measures to foster a decentralized network that's well-equipped to fend off potential threats by inviting a broader spectrum of stakeholders to partake as validators. Through NPoS, individuals from diverse backgrounds are able to engage actively in staking, far more so than with typical PoS networks such as Ethereum which does not feature nominators. The deliberate inclusivity of Polkadot’s NPoS curtails the danger of centralization and elevates the resilience of the validator network.</p><p><a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools\">Nomination pools</a> have recently been added to Polkadot’s staking system to increase participation. These pools allow users with smaller stakes to nominate and earn rewards by pooling their tokens and delegating them to validators. By applying this elegant solution, participation is democratized, fostering a decentralized, equitable ecosystem while leveling the playing field.</p><p>Learn more about Polkadot stalking in <a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking\">this Wiki guide</a>.</p><p><strong>2. Decision making via open governance</strong></p><p>All DOT token holders can actively participate in decision-making on behalf of how the Polkadot network is run via the unique governance model <a href=\"https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/?utm_source=polkadot.network&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=system%20parachains&amp;utm_content=blog\">Polkadot OpenGov</a>. The community can propose network upgrades, parameter adjustments, and policy changes through referenda. Rather than being controlled by a centralized authority, this open and transparent governance approach allows decisions to be made collectively, reflecting the interests of the community.</p><p><strong>3. User interaction with Polkadot via a decentralized light client</strong></p><p>Polkadot’s <a href=\"https://www.parity.io/blog/introducing-substrate-connect?utm_source=polkadot.network&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=system%20parachains&amp;utm_content=blog\">Substrate Connect</a> trustless light client allows users to interact with multiple blockchains without relying on a central authority to access information. Users are empowered to take full control of their interactions with the blockchain network by facilitating decentralized access.</p><p>The absence of light clients can be problematic even in highly decentralized networks. As a result, users often rely on centralized service providers, which leads to frequent failures and disruptions. Providing users with light clients will ensure smoother and more reliable interactions with the decentralized network.</p><h2 id=\"polkadot-consensus-building-a-decentralized-and-secure-future\">Polkadot consensus: building a decentralized and secure future</h2><p>From the early days of Polkadot’s conception, the founders recognized the importance of decentralization and inclusivity. PoW systems of the past were both exclusive and energy-intensive, favoring those with extensive computing power. In search of a more environmentally friendly and accessible alternative, Polkadot employed a PoS consensus system from the time it launched (until NPoS was constructed to improve on PoS).</p><p>Depending on the volume of tokens a validator stakes, they have a higher chance of being selected as a validator in a PoS system. While this provides a more energy-efficient and eco-friendly method of securing the network, it also creates a potential centralization problem.</p><p>In PoS, power and influence could be concentrated among a select few with substantial token holdings. The decision-making and governance processes of a network could be dominated by a small group of validators when they control the majority of its resources. This concentration of power contradicts the core values of blockchain, namely decentralization, transparency, and inclusivity.</p><p>The degree to which a blockchain is deemed decentralized is determined by the number of independent nodes or entities participating in its adopted consensus. Within PoS consensus, the metric to determine the number of contributors to consensus is called the validator count.</p><p>There is generally a correlation between a higher validator count and greater decentralization because having more validator participation reduces the control and influence that any single entity can exert over network decisions. However, after the Ethereum Merge, the importance of the validator count as the sole metric for decentralization has diminished. The degree of a network's decentralization and security should rather be determined by additional factors such as:</p><ul><li>Stake distribution</li><li>Collusion resistance</li><li>Diversity of clients</li><li>Active participation</li><li>Geographic diversity of validators</li></ul><p>Therefore, to assess Ethereum 2.0 and similar PoS blockchains, it becomes crucial to take into account these aspects.</p><h3 id=\"how-npos-supports-decentralization\">How NPoS supports decentralization</h3><p>NPoS implements incentives that drive the network toward greater decentralization when factors such as the number of validators and the diversity of entities operating them are kept constant. In combination with features that enhanced the validator landscape, NPoS contributes to heightened decentralization compared to other PoS networks.</p><p>NPoS boasts two key attributes that substantially bolster decentralization:</p><p><strong>1.Flexible nominator choices</strong></p><p>Nominators can select, or nominate multiple validators (up to 16 validators in Polkadot and up to 24 validators in Kusama). As long as at least one of the validators nominated is chosen, the election mechanism ensures that the entire stake contributed by nominators is utilized. This unique feature significantly enhances decentralization and economic security within NPoS, setting it apart from other PoS systems.</p><p>The inclusion of nominators within NPoS yields notable benefits because it boosts validator stake: nominators' participation bolsters the stake supporting validators, consequently enhancing the network's economic security. It also lowers the barriers to entry for users with smaller DOT holdings to participate in staking.</p><p><strong>2. Empowering emerging validators</strong></p><p>Validators in NPoS have the advantage that validators who are bootstrapping can be funded without risk by nominators. Nominators are fully rewarded even if only one nominated validator is selected (possibly a well-funded and robust one), as the entire stake contributes to network security and by backing promising new validators that they deem to be behaving well, nominators can take calculated risks. While aligning incentives to maximize rewards, regardless of selection outcomes, this approach fosters decentralization without compromising economic security.</p><p>In typical PoS systems, unselected stakes remain inactive, which results in capital inefficiency.</p><h2 id=\"the-benefits-of-polkadot-npos\">The benefits of Polkadot NPoS</h2><p>By adopting NPoS, Polkadot gained several key advantages. Along with improving security, NPoS encourages greater community involvement, thereby increasing the network's resilience. Token holders from diverse backgrounds can actively contribute to strengthening the economic security of the network (with few limitations) and get rewarded for participating in governance and validation (staking). Not only does this level the playing field for blockchain participants, it also promotes decentralization of power within the blockspace ecosystem. By allowing token holders to nominate validators, NPoS can also enhance the transaction processing capacity of a network and facilitate smoother operations.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image4.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/image4.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/image4.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image4.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"design-decisions-and-goals-of-npos\"><strong>Design decisions and goals of NPoS</strong></h2><p>Polkadot's patented NPoS is the result of meticulous design decisions geared towards creating a secure, decentralized network. This is achieved through a set of innovative mechanisms:</p><p><strong>Economic security and resilience</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Election algorithm</strong><br>Unlike PoS, economic security within NPoS is also driven by the fact that nominators can use their funds without the know-how and resources required to become a validator. An election algorithm (described in more detail later) determines the best validator candidates which maximizes economic security.<br><br>With NPoS, the number of tokens supporting validators is increased compared to PoS, which has boosted the economic security of the Polkadot ecosystem. A substantial increase has also been made to the minimum stake, so even the least supported validator receives more support.</li><li><strong>Slashing mechanism</strong><br>Just like PoS, NPoS also implements a slashing mechanism. When a validator engages in malicious behavior or violates the system, a portion of their staked tokens can be lost. The alignment of incentives through stake increases the likelihood of robust slashing and increases the economic consequences of bad behavior, thereby making the ecosystem more secure.</li></ul><p><strong>Accessibility and decentralization</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Participation</strong><br>DOT holders can nominate validators from 450.994 DOT at the time of writing and select on the basis of whether they are trusted to secure the network. The addition of easy and accessible nominations within NPoS made participation in the staking process far easier, and that was before nomination pools launched.<br><br>The launch of nomination pools on Nov 1, 2002 significantly stimulated active accounts. In 2023, the number of pools has more than doubled, and the number of pool members has more than tripled. This has resulted in Polkadot being more economically secure, as NPoS has created a more inclusive ecosystem.<br><br>Consider a situation where 100M nominators are backing 100 validators. If the same 100 validators were controlled by two entities (for example, Amazon and Google), they would effectively control the network, and the blockchain would therefore not be decentralized.<br><br>In the validator selection process, stake-based factors are combined in order to increase decentralization and economic security, ensuring a diverse and decentralized network. Validators are chosen based on the number of nominations they receive and their staked DOT tokens. The active validator set is regularly updated to encourage competition and to enable new validators to participate, fostering an open and inclusive ecosystem where stakeholders can voice their concerns.</li><li><strong>Nomination pools</strong><br>Staking and network participation are more accessible to a broader audience using nomination pools. To not introduce an element of centralization, it is important that nomination pools are native. Nomination pools on Polkadot empower individuals who might otherwise be excluded from the staking process by allowing them to pool their resources, share rewards, and contribute to network security together with as little as 1 DOT. As a result of this inclusive approach, blockchain networks can be both decentralized and accessible.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview?utm_source=polkadot.network&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=system%20parachains&amp;utm_content=blog\">Explore how to stake on Polkadot</a></p><h3 id=\"the-role-of-stake-distribution\">The role of stake distribution</h3><p>Implementing NPoS brought significant changes to stake distribution, which further enhanced economic security and fairness.</p><h4 id=\"stake-distribution\">Stake distribution</h4><p>Stake distribution in Polkadot aligns validators and nominators interests network stability to ensure economic security. Distributing nominator's staked tokens among validators mitigates centralization risks, discourages collusion, and promotes ecosystem resilience.</p><p>As a result of this equitable engagement, honest network participation is encouraged and malicious behavior is safeguarded, thereby enhancing network security. According to this system, prospective validators express their desire to become candidates for validation, and  these candidacies are transparently shared with all nominators. Nominators can compile a roster of up to 16 preferred candidates, and their stakes are systematically allocated between validators in a balanced manner to ensure economic security.</p><p>NPoS helps distribute stake to validators who may otherwise be excluded from participation, which further boosts the decentralization and economic security of the Polkadot ecosystem. In NPoS, nominators also earn more rewards when supporting validators with a smaller total stake behind them. This incentivizes nominators to choose validators with lower total stake, further contributing to the even distribution of stake across the potential validator set.</p><h4 id=\"the-phr%C3%A1gmen-election-algorithm\">The Phrágmen election algorithm</h4><p>Validators are selected in a more fair and more secure manner thanks to a reworked election algorithm based on a sequential Phragmén method introduced by Edvard Phragmén in the 1890s. The Phrágmen election is a multi-winner election algorithm that combines off-chain computations with on-chain verification to ensure accuracy.</p><p>Security, scalability, and community participation have improved since the adoption of NPoS. The validator set has been constantly expanding since launch to further improve security and resilience. More improvements are currently being explored including an improved election algorithm and the possibility of staking on a dedicated system parachain, paving the way for more advanced and robust staking.</p><h2 id=\"contribute-to-the-decentralized-future-start-staking-with-polkadot\">Contribute to the decentralized future: start staking with Polkadot</h2><p>The aim of Polkadot is to create a blockspace ecosystem that is truly decentralized and transformative, capable of navigating the challenges facing Web3.
